| **[FreeArt3D: Training-Free Articulated Object Generation using 3D Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25765v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Articulated 3D objects are central to many applications in robotics, AR/VR, and animation. Recent approaches to modeling such objects either rely on optimization-based reconstruction pipelines that require dense-view supervision or on feed-forward generative models that produce coarse geometric approximations and often overlook surface texture. In contrast, open-world 3D generation of static objects has achieved remarkable success, especially with the advent of native 3D diffusion models such as Trellis. However, extending these methods to articulated objects by training native 3D diffusion models poses significant challenges. In this work, we present FreeArt3D, a training-free framework for articulated 3D object generation. Instead of training a new model on limited articulated data, FreeArt3D repurposes a pre-trained static 3D diffusion model (e.g., Trellis) as a powerful shape prior. It extends Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) into the 3D-to-4D domain by treating articulation as an additional generative dimension. Given a few images captured in different articulation states, FreeArt3D jointly optimizes the object's geometry, texture, and articulation parameters without requiring task-specific training or access to large-scale articulated datasets. Our method generates high-fidelity geometry and textures, accurately predicts underlying kinematic structures, and generalizes well across diverse object categories. Despite following a per-instance optimization paradigm, FreeArt3D completes in minutes and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art approaches in both quality and versatility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Physics-Guided Conditional Diffusion Networks for Microwave Image Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25729v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A conditional latent-diffusion based framework for solving the electromagnetic inverse scattering problem associated with microwave imaging is introduced. This generative machine-learning model explicitly mirrors the non-uniqueness of the ill-posed inverse problem. Unlike existing inverse solvers utilizing deterministic machine learning techniques that produce a single reconstruction, the proposed latent-diffusion model generates multiple plausible permittivity maps conditioned on measured scattered-field data, thereby generating several potential instances in the range-space of the non-unique inverse mapping. A forward electromagnetic solver is integrated into the reconstruction pipeline as a physics-based evaluation mechanism. The space of candidate reconstructions form a distribution of possibilities consistent with the conditioning data and the member of this space yielding the lowest scattered-field data discrepancy between the predicted and measured scattered fields is reported as the final solution. Synthetic and experimental labeled datasets are used for training and evaluation of the model. An innovative labeled synthetic dataset is created that exemplifies a varied set of scattering features. Training of the model using this new dataset produces high quality permittivity reconstructions achieving improved generalization with excellent fidelity to shape recognition. The results highlight the potential of hybrid generative physics frameworks as a promising direction for robust, data-driven microwave imaging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Error Bounds and Optimal Schedules for Masked Diffusions with Factorized Approximations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25544v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently proposed generative models for discrete data, such as Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs), exploit conditional independence approximations to reduce the computational cost of popular Auto-Regressive Models (ARMs), at the price of some bias in the sampling distribution. We study the resulting computation-vs-accuracy trade-off, providing general error bounds (in relative entropy) that depend only on the average number of tokens generated per iteration and are independent of the data dimensionality (i.e. sequence length), thus supporting the empirical success of MDMs. We then investigate the gain obtained by using non-constant schedule sizes (i.e. varying the number of unmasked tokens during the generation process) and identify the optimal schedule as a function of a so-called information profile of the data distribution, thus allowing for a principled optimization of schedule sizes. We define methods directly as sampling algorithms and do not use classical derivations as time-reversed diffusion processes, leading us to simple and transparent proofs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Temporal Consistency and Fidelity at Inference-time in Perceptual Video Restoration by Zero-shot Image-based Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25420v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as powerful priors for single-image restoration, but their application to zero-shot video restoration suffers from temporal inconsistencies due to the stochastic nature of sampling and complexity of incorporating explicit temporal modeling. In this work, we address the challenge of improving temporal coherence in video restoration using zero-shot image-based diffusion models without retraining or modifying their architecture. We propose two complementary inference-time strategies: (1) Perceptual Straightening Guidance (PSG) based on the neuroscience-inspired perceptual straightening hypothesis, which steers the diffusion denoising process towards smoother temporal evolution by incorporating a curvature penalty in a perceptual space to improve temporal perceptual scores, such as Fr\'echet Video Distance (FVD) and perceptual straightness; and (2) Multi-Path Ensemble Sampling (MPES), which aims at reducing stochastic variation by ensembling multiple diffusion trajectories to improve fidelity (distortion) scores, such as PSNR and SSIM, without sacrificing sharpness. Together, these training-free techniques provide a practical path toward temporally stable high-fidelity perceptual video restoration using large pretrained diffusion models. We performed extensive experiments over multiple datasets and degradation types, systematically evaluating each strategy to understand their strengths and limitations. Our results show that while PSG enhances temporal naturalness, particularly in case of temporal blur, MPES consistently improves fidelity and spatio-temporal perception--distortion trade-off across all tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion-Driven Progressive Target Manipulation for Source-Free Domain Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25279v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) is a challenging task that tackles domain shifts using only a pre-trained source model and unlabeled target data. Existing SFDA methods are restricted by the fundamental limitation of source-target domain discrepancy. Non-generation SFDA methods suffer from unreliable pseudo-labels in challenging scenarios with large domain discrepancies, while generation-based SFDA methods are evidently degraded due to enlarged domain discrepancies in creating pseudo-source data. To address this limitation, we propose a novel generation-based framework named Diffusion-Driven Progressive Target Manipulation (DPTM) that leverages unlabeled target data as references to reliably generate and progressively refine a pseudo-target domain for SFDA. Specifically, we divide the target samples into a trust set and a non-trust set based on the reliability of pseudo-labels to sufficiently and reliably exploit their information. For samples from the non-trust set, we develop a manipulation strategy to semantically transform them into the newly assigned categories, while simultaneously maintaining them in the target distribution via a latent diffusion model. Furthermore, we design a progressive refinement mechanism that progressively reduces the domain discrepancy between the pseudo-target domain and the real target domain via iterative refinement. Experimental results demonstrate that DPTM outperforms existing methods by a large margin and achieves state-of-the-art performance on four prevailing SFDA benchmark datasets with different scales. Remarkably, DPTM can significantly enhance the performance by up to 18.6% in scenarios with large source-target gaps.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Energy Approach from $\varepsilon$-Graph to Continuum Diffusion Model with Connectivity Functional](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25114v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We derive an energy-based continuum limit for $\varepsilon$-graphs endowed with a general connectivity functional. We prove that the discrete energy and its continuum counterpart differ by at most $O(\varepsilon)$; the prefactor involves only the $W^{1,1}$-norm of the connectivity density as $\varepsilon\to0$, so the error bound remains valid even when that density has strong local fluctuations. As an application, we introduce a neural-network procedure that reconstructs the connectivity density from edge-weight data and then embeds the resulting continuum model into a brain-dynamics framework. In this setting, the usual constant diffusion coefficient is replaced by the spatially varying coefficient produced by the learned density, yielding dynamics that differ significantly from those obtained with conventional constant-diffusion models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pixel-Perfect Depth with Semantics-Prompted Diffusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07316v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents Pixel-Perfect Depth, a monocular depth estimation model based on pixel-space diffusion generation that produces high-quality, flying-pixel-free point clouds from estimated depth maps. Current generative depth estimation models fine-tune Stable Diffusion and achieve impressive performance. However, they require a VAE to compress depth maps into latent space, which inevitably introduces \textit{flying pixels} at edges and details. Our model addresses this challenge by directly performing diffusion generation in the pixel space, avoiding VAE-induced artifacts. To overcome the high complexity associated with pixel-space generation, we introduce two novel designs: 1) Semantics-Prompted Diffusion Transformers (SP-DiT), which incorporate semantic representations from vision foundation models into DiT to prompt the diffusion process, thereby preserving global semantic consistency while enhancing fine-grained visual details; and 2) Cascade DiT Design that progressively increases the number of tokens to further enhance efficiency and accuracy. Our model achieves the best performance among all published generative models across five benchmarks, and significantly outperforms all other models in edge-aware point cloud evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025.

| **[LRT-Diffusion: Calibrated Risk-Aware Guidance for Diffusion Policies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24983v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion policies are competitive for offline reinforcement learning (RL) but are typically guided at sampling time by heuristics that lack a statistical notion of risk. We introduce LRT-Diffusion, a risk-aware sampling rule that treats each denoising step as a sequential hypothesis test between the unconditional prior and the state-conditional policy head. Concretely, we accumulate a log-likelihood ratio and gate the conditional mean with a logistic controller whose threshold tau is calibrated once under H0 to meet a user-specified Type-I level alpha. This turns guidance from a fixed push into an evidence-driven adjustment with a user-interpretable risk budget. Importantly, we deliberately leave training vanilla (two heads with standard epsilon-prediction) under the structure of DDPM. LRT guidance composes naturally with Q-gradients: critic-gradient updates can be taken at the unconditional mean, at the LRT-gated mean, or a blend, exposing a continuum from exploitation to conservatism. We standardize states and actions consistently at train and test time and report a state-conditional out-of-distribution (OOD) metric alongside return. On D4RL MuJoCo tasks, LRT-Diffusion improves the return-OOD trade-off over strong Q-guided baselines in our implementation while honoring the desired alpha. Theoretically, we establish level-alpha calibration, concise stability bounds, and a return comparison showing when LRT surpasses Q-guidance-especially when off-support errors dominate. Overall, LRT-Diffusion is a drop-in, inference-time method that adds principled, calibrated risk control to diffusion policies for offline RL.</p></details> |  |
| **[CANDI: Hybrid Discrete-Continuous Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22510v2)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While continuous diffusion has shown remarkable success in continuous domains such as image generation, its direct application to discrete data has underperformed compared to purely discrete formulations. This gap is counterintuitive, given that continuous diffusion learns score functions that enable joint evolution across multiple positions. To understand this gap, we introduce token identifiability as an analytical framework for understanding how Gaussian noise corrupts discrete data through two mechanisms: discrete identity corruption and continuous rank degradation. We reveal that these mechanisms scale differently with vocabulary size, creating a temporal dissonance: at noise levels where discrete corruption preserves enough structure for conditional learning, continuous denoising is trivial; at noise levels where continuous denoising is meaningful, discrete corruption destroys nearly all conditional structure. To solve this, we propose CANDI (Continuous ANd DIscrete diffusion), a hybrid framework that decouples discrete and continuous corruption, enabling simultaneous learning of both conditional structure and continuous geometry. We empirically validate the temporal dissonance phenomenon and demonstrate that CANDI successfully avoids it. This unlocks the benefits of continuous diffusion for discrete spaces: on controlled generation, CANDI enables classifier-based guidance with off-the-shelf classifiers through simple gradient addition; on text generation, CANDI outperforms masked diffusion at low NFE, demonstrating the value of learning continuous gradients for discrete spaces. We include the code on the project page available here: https://patrickpynadath1.github.io/candi-lander</p></details> |  |
| **[Non-Markovian Discrete Diffusion with Causal Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09767v3)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discrete diffusion models offer a flexible, controllable approach to structured sequence generation, yet they still lag behind causal language models in expressive power. A key limitation lies in their reliance on the Markovian assumption, which restricts each step to condition only on the current state, leading to potential uncorrectable error accumulation. In this paper, we introduce CaDDi (Causal Discrete Diffusion Model), a discrete diffusion model that conditions on the entire generative trajectory, thereby lifting the Markov constraint and allowing the model to revisit and improve past states. By unifying sequential (causal) and temporal (diffusion) reasoning in a single non-Markovian transformer, CaDDi also treats standard causal language models as a special case and permits the direct reuse of pretrained LLM weights with no architectural changes. Empirically, CaDDi outperforms state-of-the-art discrete diffusion baselines on natural-language benchmarks, substantially narrowing the remaining gap to large autoregressive transformers.</p></details> | <details><summary>39th ...</summary><p>39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Uniform Discrete Diffusion with Metric Path for Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24717v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continuous-space video generation has advanced rapidly, while discrete approaches lag behind due to error accumulation and long-context inconsistency. In this work, we revisit discrete generative modeling and present Uniform discRete diffuSion with metric pAth (URSA), a simple yet powerful framework that bridges the gap with continuous approaches for the scalable video generation. At its core, URSA formulates the video generation task as an iterative global refinement of discrete spatiotemporal tokens. It integrates two key designs: a Linearized Metric Path and a Resolution-dependent Timestep Shifting mechanism. These designs enable URSA to scale efficiently to high-resolution image synthesis and long-duration video generation, while requiring significantly fewer inference steps. Additionally, we introduce an asynchronous temporal fine-tuning strategy that unifies versatile tasks within a single model, including interpolation and image-to-video generation. Extensive experiments on challenging video and image generation benchmarks demonstrate that URSA consistently outperforms existing discrete methods and achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art continuous diffusion methods. Code and models are available at https://github.com/baaivision/URSA</p></details> | 19 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Routing Matters in MoE: Scaling Diffusion Transformers with Explicit Routing Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24711v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for scaling model capacity while preserving computational efficiency. Despite its notable success in large language models (LLMs), existing attempts to apply MoE to Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have yielded limited gains. We attribute this gap to fundamental differences between language and visual tokens. Language tokens are semantically dense with pronounced inter-token variation, while visual tokens exhibit spatial redundancy and functional heterogeneity, hindering expert specialization in vision MoE. To this end, we present ProMoE, an MoE framework featuring a two-step router with explicit routing guidance that promotes expert specialization. Specifically, this guidance encourages the router to partition image tokens into conditional and unconditional sets via conditional routing according to their functional roles, and refine the assignments of conditional image tokens through prototypical routing with learnable prototypes based on semantic content. Moreover, the similarity-based expert allocation in latent space enabled by prototypical routing offers a natural mechanism for incorporating explicit semantic guidance, and we validate that such guidance is crucial for vision MoE. Building on this, we propose a routing contrastive loss that explicitly enhances the prototypical routing process, promoting intra-expert coherence and inter-expert diversity. Extensive experiments on ImageNet benchmark demonstrate that ProMoE surpasses state-of-the-art methods under both Rectified Flow and DDPM training objectives. Code and models will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reduced Basis Approach for Convection-Diffusion Equations with Non-Linear Boundary Reaction Conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24632v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper aims at an efficient strategy to solve drift-diffusion problems with non-linear boundary conditions as they appear, e.g., in heterogeneous catalysis. Since the non-linearity only involves the degrees of freedom along (a part of) the boundary, a reduced basis ansatz is suggested that computes discrete Green's-like functions for the present drift-diffusion operator such that the global non-linear problem reduces to a smaller non-linear problem for a boundary method. The computed basis functions are completely independent of the non-linearities. Thus, they can be reused for problems with the same differential operator and geometry. Corresponding scenarios might be inverse problems in heterogeneous catalysis but also modeling the effect of different catalysts in the same reaction chamber. The strategy is explained for a mass-conservative finite volume method and demonstrated on a simple numerical example for catalytic CO oxidation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion LLM with Native Variable Generation Lengths: Let [EOS] Lead the Way](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24605v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have exhibited substantial potential for parallel text generation, which may enable more efficient generation compared to autoregressive models. However, current dLLMs suffer from fixed generation lengths, which indicates the generation lengths of dLLMs have to be determined before decoding as a hyper-parameter, leading to issues in efficiency and flexibility. To solve these problems, in this work, we propose to train a diffusion LLM with native variable generation lengths, abbreviated as dLLM-Var. Concretely, we aim to train a model to accurately predict the [EOS] token in the generated text, which makes a dLLM be able to natively infer in a block diffusion manner, while still maintaining the ability of global bi-directional (full) attention and high parallelism. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves a 30.1x speedup over traditional dLLM inference paradigms and a 2.4x speedup relative to autoregressive models such as Qwen and Llama. Our method achieves higher accuracy and faster inference, elevating dLLMs beyond mere academic novelty and supporting their practical use in real-world applications. Codes and models have been released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unbiased likelihood estimation of the Langevin diffusion for animal movement modelling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24539v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The resource selection function provides a model for describing habitat suitability, which can be used to predict the spatial utilisation distribution of a species. Tracking data can be modelled as a point process, but this is made complicated by the presence of temporally irregular autocorrelation. One proposed model to handle this is the continuous-time Langevin diffusion. However, current estimation techniques obtain increasingly biased parameter estimates as the intervals between observations increase. In this paper, we address this issue using Brownian bridges in an importance sampling scheme to improve the likelihood approximation of the Langevin diffusion model. We show using a series of simulation studies that this approach effectively removes the bias in many scenarios. Furthermore, we show that the model actually performs better at lower sampling rates over a longer duration than shorter duration at a higher sampling frequency. This research broadens the applicability of Langevin diffusion models to telemetry data at coarser resolutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Models for Wireless Transceivers: From Pilot-Efficient Channel Estimation to AI-Native 6G Receivers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24495v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the development of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, implementing AI-based techniques to improve wireless transceivers becomes an emerging research topic. Within this context, AI-based channel characterization and estimation become the focus since these methods have not been solved by traditional methods very well and have become the bottleneck of transceiver efficiency in large-scale orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. Specifically, by formulating channel estimation as a generative AI problem, generative AI methods such as diffusion models (DMs) can efficiently deal with rough initial estimations and have great potential to cooperate with traditional signal processing methods. This paper focuses on the transceiver design of OFDM systems based on DMs, provides an illustration of the potential of DMs in wireless transceivers, and points out the related research directions brought by DMs. We also provide a proof-of-concept case study of further adapting DMs for better wireless receiver performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for potential publication in IEEE Wireless Communications</p></details> |
| **[Discrete Diffusion VLA: Bringing Discrete Diffusion to Action Decoding in Vision-Language-Action Policies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20072v2)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models adapt large vision-language backbones to map images and instructions into robot actions. However, prevailing VLAs either generate actions auto-regressively in a fixed left-to-right order or attach separate MLP or diffusion heads outside the backbone, leading to fragmented information pathways and specialized training requirements that hinder a unified, scalable architecture. We present Discrete Diffusion VLA, a unified-transformer policy that models discretized action chunks with discrete diffusion. The design retains diffusion's progressive refinement paradigm while remaining natively compatible with the discrete token interface of VLMs. Our method achieves an adaptive decoding order that resolves easy action elements before harder ones and uses secondary re-masking to revisit uncertain predictions across refinement rounds, which improves consistency and enables robust error correction. This unified decoder preserves pre-trained vision-language priors, supports parallel decoding, breaks the autoregressive bottleneck, and reduces the number of function evaluations. Discrete Diffusion VLA achieves 96.3% avg. success rates on LIBERO, 71.2% visual matching on SimplerEnv-Fractal and 54.2% overall on SimplerEnv-Bridge, improving over autoregressive, MLP decoder and continuous diffusion baselines. These findings indicate that discrete-diffusion VLA supports precise action modeling and consistent training, laying groundwork for scaling VLA to larger models and datasets.

| **[Pair Approximation Meets Reality: Diffusion of Innovation in Organizational Networks within the biased-independence q-Voter Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24447v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collective adaptation, whether in innovation adoption, pro-environmental or organizational change, emerges from the interplay between individual decisions and social influence. Agent-based modeling provides a useful tool for studying such processes. Here, we introduce the biased-independence $q$-voter model, a generalization of the $q$-voter model with independence, one of the most popular agent-based models of opinion dynamics. In our model, individuals choose between two options, adopt or not adopt, under the competing influences of conformity and independent choice. Independent choice between two options is determined by an engagement parameter, inspired by earlier agent-based model of eco-innovation diffusion. When the engagement parameter equals $0.5$, the model reduces to the original $q$-voter model with independence; values different from $0.5$ break the symmetry between the two options. To place our study in a broader context, we briefly review asymmetric versions of the $q$-voter model proposed to date. The novelty of this work goes beyond introducing a generalized model: we develop the pair approximation (PA) for an asymmetric $q$-voter model and, for the first time, validate it on empirical organizational networks. Our results show that the interplay of social influence, independence, and option preference generates discontinuous phase transitions and irreversible hysteresis, reflecting path-dependent adoption dynamics. Surprisingly, the PA agrees well with Monte Carlo simulations on some empirical networks, even small ones, highlighting its potential as a computationally efficient bridge between individual decision-making and collective actions.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Why Diffusion Models Don't Memorize: The Role of Implicit Dynamical Regularization in Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17638v2)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of generative tasks. A key challenge is understanding the mechanisms that prevent their memorization of training data and allow generalization. In this work, we investigate the role of the training dynamics in the transition from generalization to memorization. Through extensive experiments and theoretical analysis, we identify two distinct timescales: an early time $\tau_\mathrm{gen}$ at which models begin to generate high-quality samples, and a later time $\tau_\mathrm{mem}$ beyond which memorization emerges. Crucially, we find that $\tau_\mathrm{mem}$ increases linearly with the training set size $n$, while $\tau_\mathrm{gen}$ remains constant. This creates a growing window of training times with $n$ where models generalize effectively, despite showing strong memorization if training continues beyond it. It is only when $n$ becomes larger than a model-dependent threshold that overfitting disappears at infinite training times. These findings reveal a form of implicit dynamical regularization in the training dynamics, which allow to avoid memorization even in highly overparameterized settings. Our results are supported by numerical experiments with standard U-Net architectures on realistic and synthetic datasets, and by a theoretical analysis using a tractable random features model studied in the high-dimensional limit.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as an oral at Neurips 2025. 40 pages, 15 figures</p></details> |

In this work, we leverage pre-trained diffusion models as expressive priors to capture complex action dependencies and develop a practical algorithm that efficiently approximates posteriors under such priors, enabling both fast updates and sampling. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our approach across diverse contextual bandit settings.</p></details> | Neurips 2025 |
| **[Beyond Inference Intervention: Identity-Decoupled Diffusion for Face Anonymization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24213v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Face anonymization aims to conceal identity information while preserving non-identity attributes. Mainstream diffusion models rely on inference-time interventions such as negative guidance or energy-based optimization, which are applied post-training to suppress identity features. These interventions often introduce distribution shifts and entangle identity with non-identity attributes, degrading visual fidelity and data utility. To address this, we propose \textbf{ID\textsuperscript{2}Face}, a training-centric anonymization framework that removes the need for inference-time optimization. The rationale of our method is to learn a structured latent space where identity and non-identity information are explicitly disentangled, enabling direct and controllable anonymization at inference. To this end, we design a conditional diffusion model with an identity-masked learning scheme. An Identity-Decoupled Latent Recomposer uses an Identity Variational Autoencoder to model identity features, while non-identity attributes are extracted from same-identity pairs and aligned through bidirectional latent alignment. An Identity-Guided Latent Harmonizer then fuses these representations via soft-gating conditioned on noisy feature prediction. The model is trained with a recomposition-based reconstruction loss to enforce disentanglement. At inference, anonymization is achieved by sampling a random identity vector from the learned identity space. To further suppress identity leakage, we introduce an Orthogonal Identity Mapping strategy that enforces orthogonality between sampled and source identity vectors. Experiments demonstrate that ID\textsuperscript{2}Face outperforms existing methods in visual quality, identity suppression, and utility preservation.</p></details> |  |
| **[ETC: training-free diffusion models acceleration with Error-aware Trend Consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24129v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved remarkable generative quality but remain bottlenecked by costly iterative sampling. Recent training-free methods accelerate diffusion process by reusing model outputs. However, these methods ignore denoising trends and lack error control for model-specific tolerance, leading to trajectory deviations under multi-step reuse and exacerbating inconsistencies in the generated results. To address these issues, we introduce Error-aware Trend Consistency (ETC), a framework that (1) introduces a consistent trend predictor that leverages the smooth continuity of diffusion trajectories, projecting historical denoising patterns into stable future directions and progressively distributing them across multiple approximation steps to achieve acceleration without deviating; (2) proposes a model-specific error tolerance search mechanism that derives corrective thresholds by identifying transition points from volatile semantic planning to stable quality refinement. Experiments show that ETC achieves a 2.65x acceleration over FLUX with negligible (-0.074 SSIM score) degradation of consistency.</p></details> | 17 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Information-Theoretic Discrete Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24088v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present an information-theoretic framework for discrete diffusion models that yields principled estimators of log-likelihood using score-matching losses. Inspired by the I-MMSE identity for the Gaussian setup, we derive analogous results for the discrete setting. Specifically, we introduce the Information-Minimum Denoising Score Entropy (I-MDSE) relation, which links mutual information between data and its diffused version to the minimum denoising score entropy (DSE) loss. We extend this theory to masked diffusion and establish the Information-Minimum Denoising Cross-Entropy (I-MDCE) relation, connecting cross-entropy losses to mutual information in discrete masked processes. These results provide a time-integral decomposition of the log-likelihood of the data in terms of optimal score-based losses, showing that commonly used losses such as DSE and DCE are not merely variational bounds but tight and principled estimators of log-likelihood. The I-MDCE decomposition further enables practical extensions, including time-free formula, conditional likelihood estimation in prompt-response tasks, and coupled Monte Carlo estimation of likelihood ratios. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data confirm the accuracy, variance stability, and utility of our estimators.

| **[VSA: Faster Video Diffusion with Trainable Sparse Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13389v5)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling video diffusion transformers (DiTs) is limited by their quadratic 3D attention, even though most of the attention mass concentrates on a small subset of positions. We turn this observation into VSA, a trainable, hardware-efficient sparse attention that replaces full attention at \emph{both} training and inference. In VSA, a lightweight coarse stage pools tokens into tiles and identifies high-weight \emph{critical tokens}; a fine stage computes token-level attention only inside those tiles subjecting to block computing layout to ensure hard efficiency. This leads to a single differentiable kernel that trains end-to-end, requires no post-hoc profiling, and sustains 85\% of FlashAttention3 MFU. We perform a large sweep of ablation studies and scaling-law experiments by pretraining DiTs from 60M to 1.4B parameters. VSA reaches a Pareto point that cuts training FLOPS by 2.53$\times$ with no drop in diffusion loss. Retrofitting the open-source Wan-2.1 model speeds up attention time by 6$\times$ and lowers end-to-end generation time from 31s to 18s with comparable quality.

| **[Unveiling Concept Attribution in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02542v3)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have shown remarkable abilities in generating realistic and high-quality images from text prompts. However, a trained model remains largely black-box; little do we know about the roles of its components in exhibiting a concept such as objects or styles. Recent works employ causal tracing to localize knowledge-storing layers in generative models without showing how other layers contribute to the target concept. In this work, we approach diffusion models' interpretability problem from a more general perspective and pose a question: \textit{``How do model components work jointly to demonstrate knowledge?''}. To answer this question, we decompose diffusion models using component attribution, systematically unveiling the importance of each component (specifically the model parameter) in generating a concept. The proposed framework, called \textbf{C}omponent \textbf{A}ttribution for \textbf{D}iffusion Model (CAD), discovers the localization of concept-inducing (positive) components, while interestingly uncovers another type of components that contribute negatively to generating a concept, which is missing in the previous knowledge localization work. Based on this holistic understanding of diffusion models, we introduce two fast, inference-time model editing algorithms, CAD-Erase and CAD-Amplify; in particular, CAD-Erase enables erasure and CAD-Amplify allows amplification of a generated concept by ablating the positive and negative components, respectively, while retaining knowledge of other concepts. Extensive experimental results validate the significance of both positive and negative components pinpointed by our framework, demonstrating the potential of providing a complete view of interpreting generative models.

| **[Unsupervised Monocular Depth Estimation Based on Hierarchical Feature-Guided Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09782v3)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised monocular depth estimation has received widespread attention because of its capability to train without ground truth. In real-world scenarios, the images may be blurry or noisy due to the influence of weather conditions and inherent limitations of the camera. Therefore, it is particularly important to develop a robust depth estimation model. Benefiting from the training strategies of generative networks, generative-based methods often exhibit enhanced robustness. In light of this, we employ a well-converging diffusion model among generative networks for unsupervised monocular depth estimation. Additionally, we propose a hierarchical feature-guided denoising module. This model significantly enriches the model's capacity for learning and interpreting depth distribution by fully leveraging image features to guide the denoising process. Furthermore, we explore the implicit depth within reprojection and design an implicit depth consistency loss. This loss function serves to enhance the performance of the model and ensure the scale consistency of depth within a video sequence. We conduct experiments on the KITTI, Make3D, and our self-collected SIMIT datasets. The results indicate that our approach stands out among generative-based models, while also showcasing remarkable robustness.</p></details> |  |

However, these datasets often contain inappropriate or biased content, raising concerns about the generation of harmful outputs when provided with malicious text prompts. We propose Safe Text embedding Guidance (STG), a training-free approach to improve the safety of diffusion models by guiding the text embeddings during sampling. STG adjusts the text embeddings based on a safety function evaluated on the expected final denoised image, allowing the model to generate safer outputs without additional training. Theoretically, we show that STG aligns the underlying model distribution with safety constraints, thereby achieving safer outputs while minimally affecting generation quality. Experiments on various safety scenarios, including nudity, violence, and artist-style removal, show that STG consistently outperforms both training-based and training-free baselines in removing unsafe content while preserving the core semantic intent of input prompts.

We propose a constrained generative model using kinetic (underdamped) Langevin dynamics with specular reflection of velocity on the boundary defining constraints. This results in piecewise continuously differentiable noising and denoising process where the latter is characterized by a time-reversed dynamics restricted to a domain with boundary due to specular boundary condition. In addition, we also contribute to existing reflected SDEs based constrained generative models, where the stochastic dynamics is restricted through an abstract local time term. By presenting efficient numerical samplers which converge with optimal rate in terms of discretizations step, we provide a comprehensive comparison of models based on confined (specularly reflected kinetic) Langevin diffusion with models based on reflected diffusion with local time.</p></details> |  |
| **[CT-Less Attenuation Correction Using Multiview Ensemble Conditional Diffusion Model on High-Resolution Uncorrected PET Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24805v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate quantification in positron emission tomography (PET) is essential for accurate diagnostic results and effective treatment tracking. A major issue encountered in PET imaging is attenuation. Attenuation refers to the diminution of photon detected as they traverse biological tissues before reaching detectors. When such corrections are absent or inadequate, this signal degradation can introduce inaccurate quantification, making it difficult to differentiate benign from malignant conditions, and can potentially lead to misdiagnosis. Typically, this correction is done with co-computed Computed Tomography (CT) imaging to obtain structural data for calculating photon attenuation across the body. However, this methodology subjects patients to extra ionizing radiation exposure, suffers from potential spatial misregistration between PET/CT imaging sequences, and demands costly equipment infrastructure. Emerging advances in neural network architectures present an alternative approach via synthetic CT image synthesis. Our investigation reveals that Conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) can generate high quality CT images from non attenuation corrected PET images in order to correct attenuation. By utilizing all three orthogonal views from non-attenuation-corrected PET images, the DDPM approach combined with ensemble voting generates higher quality pseudo-CT images with reduced artifacts and improved slice-to-slice consistency. Results from a study of 159 head scans acquired with the Siemens Biograph Vision PET/CT scanner demonstrate both qualitative and quantitative improvements in pseudo-CT generation. The method achieved a mean absolute error of 32 $\pm$ 10.4 HU on the CT images and an average error of (1.48 $\pm$ 0.68)\% across all regions of interest when comparing PET images reconstructed using the attenuation map of the generated pseudo-CT versus the true CT.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a preprint and not the final version of this paper</p></details> |

We propose Diffusion Adaptive Text Embedding (DATE), which dynamically updates text embeddings at each diffusion timestep based on intermediate perturbed data. We formulate an optimization problem and derive an update rule that refines the text embeddings at each sampling step to improve alignment and preference between the mean predicted image and the text. This allows DATE to dynamically adapts the text conditions to the reverse-diffused images throughout diffusion sampling without requiring additional model training. Through theoretical analysis and empirical results, we show that DATE maintains the generative capability of the model while providing superior text-image alignment over fixed text embeddings across various tasks, including multi-concept generation and text-guided image editing.

Our approach builds on the observation that existing image-to-3D models for portrait generation, while capable of producing renderable 3D representations, are prone to visual artifacts, often lack of detail, and tend to fail at fully preserving the identity of the subject. On the other hand, image diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images, but besides being computationally expensive, are not grounded in 3D and thus are not directly capable of producing multi-view consistent outputs. In this work, we demonstrate that image-space diffusion models can be used to significantly enhance the quality of existing image-to-avatar methods, while maintaining 3D-awareness and running with low-latency. Our method takes a single frontal image of a subject as input, and applies a feedforward image-to-avatar generation pipeline to obtain an initial 3D representation and corresponding noisy renders. These noisy renders are then fed to a single-step diffusion model which is conditioned on input image(s), and is specifically trained to refine the renders in a multi-view consistent way. Moreover, we introduce a novel effective training strategy that includes pre-training on a large corpus of synthetic multi-view data, followed by fine-tuning on high-quality real images. We demonstrate that our approach both qualitatively and quantitatively outperforms current state-of-the-art for portrait novel-view synthesis, while being efficient in time.</p></details> |  |
| **[A PDE-Informed Latent Diffusion Model for 2-m Temperature Downscaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23866v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents a physics-conditioned latent diffusion model tailored for dynamical downscaling of atmospheric data, with a focus on reconstructing high-resolution 2-m temperature fields. Building upon a pre-existing diffusion architecture and employing a residual formulation against a reference UNet, we integrate a partial differential equation (PDE) loss term into the model's training objective. The PDE loss is computed in the full resolution (pixel) space by decoding the latent representation and is designed to enforce physical consistency through a finite-difference approximation of an effective advection-diffusion balance. Empirical observations indicate that conventional diffusion training already yields low PDE residuals, and we investigate how fine-tuning with this additional loss further regularizes the model and enhances the physical plausibility of the generated fields. The entirety of our codebase is available on Github, for future reference and development.</p></details> |  |
| **[One-Step is Enough: Sparse Autoencoders for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22366v5)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For large language models (LLMs), sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have been shown to decompose intermediate representations that often are not interpretable directly into sparse sums of interpretable features, facilitating better control and subsequent analysis. However, similar analyses and approaches have been lacking for text-to-image models. We investigate the possibility of using SAEs to learn interpretable features for SDXL Turbo, a few-step text-to-image diffusion model. To this end, we train SAEs on the updates performed by transformer blocks within SDXL Turbo's denoising U-net in its 1-step setting. Interestingly, we find that they generalize to 4-step SDXL Turbo and even to the multi-step SDXL base model (i.e., a different model) without additional training. In addition, we show that their learned features are interpretable, causally influence the generation process, and reveal specialization among the blocks. We do so by creating RIEBench, a representation-based image editing benchmark, for editing images while they are generated by turning on and off individual SAE features. This allows us to track which transformer blocks' features are the most impactful depending on the edit category. Our work is the first investigation of SAEs for interpretability in text-to-image diffusion models and our results establish SAEs as a promising approach for understanding and manipulating the internal mechanisms of text-to-image models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Variational Masked Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23606v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Masked diffusion models have recently emerged as a flexible framework for discrete generative modeling. However, a key limitation of standard masked diffusion is its inability to effectively capture dependencies among tokens that are predicted concurrently, leading to degraded generation quality when dependencies among tokens are important. To explicitly model dependencies among tokens, we propose Variational Masked Diffusion (VMD), a framework that introduces latent variables into the masked diffusion process. Through controlled experiments on synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that VMD successfully learns dependencies that conventional masked diffusion fails to capture. We further validate the effectiveness of our approach on Sudoku puzzles and text datasets, where learning of dependencies among tokens improves global consistency. Across these domains, VMD enhances both generation quality and dependency awareness, highlighting the value of integrating variational inference into masked diffusion.

However, parameter updates during training lead to catastrophic degradation in the image generation capability of the pre-trained model. We introduce MERGE, a unified model for image generation and depth estimation, starting from a fixed pre-trained text-to-image model. MERGE demonstrates that the pre-trained text-to-image model can do more than image generation, but also expand to depth estimation effortlessly. Specifically, MERGE introduces a play-and-plug framework that enables seamless switching between image generation and depth estimation modes through simple and pluggable converters. Meanwhile, we propose a Group Reuse Mechanism to encourage parameter reuse and improve the utilization of the additional learnable parameters. MERGE unleashes the powerful depth estimation capability of the pre-trained text-to-image model while preserving its original image generation ability. Compared to other unified models for image generation and depth estimation, MERGE achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple depth estimation benchmarks.

| **[Noise Diffusion for Enhancing Semantic Faithfulness in Text-to-Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16503v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved impressive success in generating photorealistic images, but challenges remain in ensuring precise semantic alignment with input prompts. Optimizing the initial noisy latent offers a more efficient alternative to modifying model architectures or prompt engineering for improving semantic alignment. A latest approach, InitNo, refines the initial noisy latent by leveraging attention maps; however, these maps capture only limited information, and the effectiveness of InitNo is highly dependent on the initial starting point, as it tends to converge on a local optimum near this point. To this end, this paper proposes leveraging the language comprehension capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs) to guide the optimization of the initial noisy latent, and introduces the Noise Diffusion process, which updates the noisy latent to generate semantically faithful images while preserving distribution consistency. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis of the condition under which the update improves semantic faithfulness. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of our framework, consistently enhancing semantic alignment across various diffusion models.

A key challenge is to identify and utilize source samples that are most relevant to the target domain. Existing approaches address this challenge by measuring domain gaps through domain classifiers, target transition dynamics modeling, or mutual information estimation using contrastive loss. However, these methods often require large target datasets, which is impractical in many real-world scenarios. In this work, we address cross-domain offline RL under a limited target data setting, identifying two primary challenges: (1) Dataset imbalance, which is caused by large source and small target datasets and leads to overfitting in neural network-based domain gap estimators, resulting in uninformative measurements; and (2) Partial domain overlap, where only a subset of the source data is closely aligned with the target domain. To overcome these issues, we propose DmC, a novel framework for cross-domain offline RL with limited target samples. Specifically, DmC utilizes $k$-nearest neighbor ($k$-NN) based estimation to measure domain proximity without neural network training, effectively mitigating overfitting. Then, by utilizing this domain proximity, we introduce a nearest-neighbor-guided diffusion model to generate additional source samples that are better aligned with the target domain, thus enhancing policy learning with more effective source samples. Through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments in diverse MuJoCo environments, we demonstrate that DmC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art cross-domain offline RL methods, achieving substantial performance gains.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at ECAI 2025; offline cross-domain reinforcement learning with a guided diffusion model;</p></details> |

Our primary motivation for TSSR is to achieve highly accurate token prediction while enabling parallel generation, a significant advantage over sequential autoregressive methods. By allowing TSSR to "see" all mesh tokens concurrently, we unlock a new level of efficiency and control. We leverage this parallel generation capability through three key innovations: 1) Decoupled Training and Hybrid Inference, which distinctly separates the DDM-based generation into a topology sculpting stage and a subsequent shape refinement stage. This strategic decoupling enables TSSR to effectively capture both intricate local topology and overarching global shape. 2) An Improved Hourglass Architecture, featuring bidirectional attention enriched by face-vertex-sequence level Rotational Positional Embeddings (RoPE), thereby capturing richer contextual information across the mesh structure. 3) A novel Connection Loss, which acts as a topological constraint to further enhance the realism and fidelity of the generated meshes. Extensive experiments on complex datasets demonstrate that TSSR generates high-quality 3D artist-style meshes, capable of achieving up to 10,000 faces at a remarkable spatial resolution of $1024^3$.

A Hybrid Alternative to Bridge the Gap](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23494v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Volumetric video relighting is essential for bringing captured performances into virtual worlds, but current approaches struggle to deliver temporally stable, production-ready results. Diffusion-based intrinsic decomposition methods show promise for single frames, yet suffer from stochastic noise and instability when extended to sequences, while video diffusion models remain constrained by memory and scale. We propose a hybrid relighting framework that combines diffusion-derived material priors with temporal regularization and physically motivated rendering. Our method aggregates multiple stochastic estimates of per-frame material properties into temporally consistent shading components, using optical-flow-guided regularization. For indirect effects such as shadows and reflections, we extract a mesh proxy from Gaussian Opacity Fields and render it within a standard graphics pipeline. Experiments on real and synthetic captures show that this hybrid strategy achieves substantially more stable relighting across sequences than diffusion-only baselines, while scaling beyond the clip lengths feasible for video diffusion. These results indicate that hybrid approaches, which balance learned priors with physically grounded constraints, are a practical step toward production-ready volumetric video relighting.</p></details> |  |

Generative models, especially diffusion models, have recently been applied to remote sensing super resolution (RSSR), yet several challenges exist. First, diffusion models are effective but require expensive training from scratch resources and have slow inference speeds. Second, current methods have limited utilization of auxiliary information as real-world constraints to reconstruct scientifically realistic images. Finally, most current methods lack evaluation on downstream tasks. In this study, we present a efficient LSSR framework for RSSR, supported by a new multimodal dataset of paired 30 m Landsat 8 and 10 m Sentinel 2 imagery. Built on frozen pretrained Stable Diffusion, LSSR integrates crossmodal attention with auxiliary knowledge (Digital Elevation Model, land cover, month) and Synthetic Aperture Radar guidance, enhanced by adapters and a tailored Fourier NDVI loss to balance spatial details and spectral fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LSSR significantly improves crop boundary delineation and recovery, achieving state-of-the-art performance with Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio/Structural Similarity Index Measure of 32.63/0.84 (RGB) and 23.99/0.78 (IR), and the lowest NDVI Mean Squared Error (0.042), while maintaining efficient inference (0.39 sec/image). Moreover, LSSR transfers effectively to NASA Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel (HLS) super resolution, yielding more reliable crop classification (F1: 0.86) than Sentinel-2 (F1: 0.85). These results highlight the potential of RSSR to advance precision agriculture.</p></details> | 41 pages |

Our theoretical investigation of ODE- and SDE-based solvers reveals complementary weaknesses: ODE solvers accumulate irreducible gradient error along deterministic trajectories, while SDE methods suffer from amplified discretization errors when the step budget is limited. Building upon this insight, we introduce AdaSDE, a novel single-step SDE solver that aims to unify the efficiency of ODEs with the error resilience of SDEs. Specifically, we introduce a single per-step learnable coefficient, estimated via lightweight distillation, which dynamically regulates the error correction strength to accelerate diffusion sampling.

Active inference (AIF) based on the free-energy principle provides a unified framework for these behaviors by minimizing the expected free energy (EFE), thereby combining epistemic and extrinsic values. To realize this practically, we propose a deep AIF framework that integrates a diffusion policy as the policy model and a multiple timescale recurrent state-space model (MTRSSM) as the world model. The diffusion policy generates diverse candidate actions while the MTRSSM predicts their long-horizon consequences through latent imagination, enabling action selection that minimizes EFE. Real-world navigation experiments demonstrated that our framework achieved higher success rates and fewer collisions compared with the baselines, particularly in exploration-demanding scenarios. These results highlight how AIF based on EFE minimization can unify exploration and goal-directed navigation in real-world robotic settings.</p></details> | Preprint version |

The unknown law $\mathbb{P}^X$ of $X$, and in particular its support $\mathscr{M}$, are accessible only through a large sample of i.i.d.\ observations. We further assume $\mathscr{M}$ to be a low-dimensional submanifold of a high-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$. As a filter or denoiser $\widehat X$, we suggest an estimator of the metric projection $\pi_{\mathscr{M}}(Y)$ of $Y$ onto the manifold $\mathscr{M}$. To compute this estimator, we study an auxiliary semiparametric model in which $Y$ is obtained by adding isotropic Laplace noise to $X$. Using score matching within a corresponding diffusion model, we obtain an estimator of the Bayesian posterior $\mathbb{P}^{X \mid Y}$ in this setup. Our main theoretical results show that, in the limit of high dimension $d$, this posterior $\mathbb{P}^{X\mid Y}$ is concentrated near the desired metric projection $\pi_{\mathscr{M}}(Y)$.</p></details> |  |

Generative artificial intelligence offers a scalable means to propose candidate crystal structures, however existing approaches mainly reproduce decorated variants of established motifs rather than uncover new configurations. Here we develop a physics-informed diffusion method, supported by chemically grounded validation protocol, which embeds descriptors of compactness and local environment diversity to balance physical plausibility with structural novelty. Conditioning on these metrics improves generative performance across architectures, increasing the fraction of structures outside 100 most common prototypes up to 67%. When crystal structure prediction (CSP) is seeded with generative structures, most candidates (97%) are reconstructed by CSP, yielding 145 (66%) low-energy frameworks not matching any known prototypes. These results show that while generative models are not substitutes for CSP, their chemically informed, diversity-guided outputs can enhance CSP efficiency, establishing a practical generative-CSP synergy for discovery-oriented exploration of chemical space.</p></details> |  |

Standard score-matching emerges as a special case of our framework when the Lie group is the translation group. We prove that our generalized generative processes arise as solutions to a new class of paired stochastic differential equations (SDEs), introduced here for the first time. We validate our approach through experiments on diverse data types, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world applications such as SO(3)-guided molecular conformer generation and modeling ligand-specific global SE(3) transformations for molecular docking, showing improvement in comparison to Riemannian diffusion on the group itself. We show that an appropriate choice of Lie group enhances learning efficiency by reducing the effective dimensionality of the trajectory space and enables the modeling of transitions between complex data distributions.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages.

| **[Residual Diffusion Bridge Model for Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23116v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion bridge models establish probabilistic paths between arbitrary paired distributions and exhibit great potential for universal image restoration. Most existing methods merely treat them as simple variants of stochastic interpolants, lacking a unified analytical perspective. Besides, they indiscriminately reconstruct images through global noise injection and removal, inevitably distorting undegraded regions due to imperfect reconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose the Residual Diffusion Bridge Model (RDBM). Specifically, we theoretically reformulate the stochastic differential equations of generalized diffusion bridge and derive the analytical formulas of its forward and reverse processes. Crucially, we leverage the residuals from given distributions to modulate the noise injection and removal, enabling adaptive restoration of degraded regions while preserving intact others. Moreover, we unravel the fundamental mathematical essence of existing bridge models, all of which are special cases of RDBM and empirically demonstrate the optimality of our proposed models. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method both qualitatively and quantitatively across diverse image restoration tasks.

Existing approaches typically rely on either large language models (LLMs) or equivariant denoising models, each with complementary strengths: LLMs excel at handling discrete atomic types but often struggle with continuous features such as atomic positions and lattice parameters, while denoising models are effective at modeling continuous variables but encounter difficulties in generating accurate atomic compositions. To bridge this gap, we propose CrysLLMGen, a hybrid framework that integrates an LLM with a diffusion model to leverage their complementary strengths for crystal material generation. During sampling, CrysLLMGen first employs a fine-tuned LLM to produce an intermediate representation of atom types, atomic coordinates, and lattice structure. While retaining the predicted atom types, it passes the atomic coordinates and lattice structure to a pre-trained equivariant diffusion model for refinement. Our framework outperforms state-of-the-art generative models across several benchmark tasks and datasets. Specifically, CrysLLMGen not only achieves a balanced performance in terms of structural and compositional validity but also generates more stable and novel materials compared to LLM-based and denoisingbased models Furthermore, CrysLLMGen exhibits strong conditional generation capabilities, effectively producing materials that satisfy user-defined constraints.

However, existing methods ignore the learning of posture-dependent task features, which are crucial for adapting dual-arm configurations to meet specific force and velocity requirements in dexterous bimanual manipulation. To address this limitation, we propose Manipulability-Aware Diffusion Policy (ManiDP), a novel imitation learning method that not only generates plausible bimanual trajectories, but also optimizes dual-arm configurations to better satisfy posture-dependent task requirements. ManiDP achieves this by extracting bimanual manipulability from expert demonstrations and encoding the encapsulated posture features using Riemannian-based probabilistic models. These encoded posture features are then incorporated into a conditional diffusion process to guide the generation of task-compatible bimanual motion sequences. We evaluate ManiDP on six real-world bimanual tasks, where the experimental results demonstrate a 39.33$\%$ increase in average manipulation success rate and a 0.45 improvement in task compatibility compared to baseline methods. This work highlights the importance of integrating posture-relevant robotic priors into bimanual skill diffusion to enable human-like adaptability and dexterity.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures, Accepted and published in IROS 2025</p></details> |

However, the use of up to billions of parameters incurs significant computational costs. Quantization offers a promising solution by reducing memory usage and accelerating inference. Nonetheless, we observe that the joint modeling of spatial and temporal information in video diffusion models (V-DMs) leads to extremely long token sequences, which introduces high calibration variance and learning challenges. To address these issues, we propose S$^2$Q-VDiT, a post-training quantization framework for V-DMs that leverages Salient data and Sparse token distillation. During the calibration phase, we identify that quantization performance is highly sensitive to the choice of calibration data. To mitigate this, we introduce \textit{Hessian-aware Salient Data Selection}, which constructs high-quality calibration datasets by considering both diffusion and quantization characteristics unique to V-DMs. To tackle the learning challenges, we further analyze the sparse attention patterns inherent in V-DMs. Based on this observation, we propose \textit{Attention-guided Sparse Token Distillation}, which exploits token-wise attention distributions to emphasize tokens that are more influential to the model's output. Under W4A6 quantization, S$^2$Q-VDiT achieves lossless performance while delivering $3.9\times$ model compression and $1.3\times$ inference acceleration.

| **[Multi-Agent Conditional Diffusion Model with Mean Field Communication as Wireless Resource Allocation Planner](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22969v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In wireless communication systems, efficient and adaptive resource allocation plays a crucial role in enhancing overall Quality of Service (QoS). While centralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) frameworks rely on a central coordinator for policy training and resource scheduling, they suffer from scalability issues and privacy risks. In contrast, the Distributed Training with Decentralized Execution (DTDE) paradigm enables distributed learning and decision-making, but it struggles with non-stationarity and limited inter-agent cooperation, which can severely degrade system performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Multi-Agent Conditional Diffusion Model Planner (MA-CDMP) for decentralized communication resource management. Built upon the Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) paradigm, MA-CDMP employs Diffusion Models (DMs) to capture environment dynamics and plan future trajectories, while an inverse dynamics model guides action generation, thereby alleviating the sample inefficiency and slow convergence of conventional DTDE methods. Moreover, to approximate large-scale agent interactions, a Mean-Field (MF) mechanism is introduced as an assistance to the classifier in DMs. This design mitigates inter-agent non-stationarity and enhances cooperation with minimal communication overhead in distributed settings. We further theoretically establish an upper bound on the distributional approximation error introduced by the MF-based diffusion generation, guaranteeing convergence stability and reliable modeling of multi-agent stochastic dynamics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MA-CDMP consistently outperforms existing MARL baselines in terms of average reward and QoS metrics, showcasing its scalability and practicality for real-world wireless network optimization.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches typically rely on perturbing text-conditioned embeddings, resulting in semantic instability and insufficient shift diversity, which limit generalization to realistic OOD. To address these challenges, we propose GOOD, a novel and flexible framework that directly guides diffusion sampling trajectories towards OOD regions using off-the-shelf in-distribution (ID) classifiers. GOOD incorporates dual-level guidance: (1) Image-level guidance based on the gradient of log partition to reduce input likelihood, drives samples toward low-density regions in pixel space. (2) Feature-level guidance, derived from k-NN distance in the classifier's latent space, promotes sampling in feature-sparse regions. Hence, this dual-guidance design enables more controllable and diverse OOD sample generation. Additionally, we introduce a unified OOD score that adaptively combines image and feature discrepancies, enhancing detection robustness. We perform thorough quantitative and qualitative analyses to evaluate the effectiveness of GOOD, demonstrating that training with samples generated by GOOD can notably enhance OOD detection performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 16 figures, conference</p></details> |
| **[Diffuse to Detect: A Generalizable Framework for Anomaly Detection with Diffusion Models Applications to UAVs and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22928v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection in complex, high-dimensional data, such as UAV sensor readings, is essential for operational safety but challenging for existing methods due to their limited sensitivity, scalability, and inability to capture intricate dependencies. We propose the Diffuse to Detect (DTD) framework, a novel approach that innovatively adapts diffusion models for anomaly detection, diverging from their conventional use in generative tasks with high inference time. By comparison, DTD employs a single-step diffusion process to predict noise patterns, enabling rapid and precise identification of anomalies without reconstruction errors. This approach is grounded in robust theoretical foundations that link noise prediction to the data distribution's score function, ensuring reliable deviation detection. By integrating Graph Neural Networks to model sensor relationships as dynamic graphs, DTD effectively captures spatial (inter-sensor) and temporal anomalies. Its two-branch architecture, with parametric neural network-based energy scoring for scalability and nonparametric statistical methods for interpretability, provides flexible trade-offs between computational efficiency and transparency. Extensive evaluations on UAV sensor data, multivariate time series, and images demonstrate DTD's superior performance over existing methods, underscoring its generality across diverse data modalities. This versatility, combined with its adaptability, positions DTD as a transformative solution for safety-critical applications, including industrial monitoring and beyond.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simple Denoising Diffusion Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22926v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have recently been extended to language generation through Masked Diffusion Language Models (MDLMs), which achieve performance competitive with strong autoregressive models. However, MDLMs tend to degrade in the few-step regime and cannot directly adopt existing few-step distillation methods designed for continuous diffusion models, as they lack the intrinsic property of mapping from noise to data. Recent Uniform-state Diffusion Models (USDMs), initialized from a uniform prior, alleviate some limitations but still suffer from complex loss formulations that hinder scalability. In this work, we propose a simplified denoising-based loss for USDMs that optimizes only noise-replaced tokens, stabilizing training and matching ELBO-level performance. Furthermore, by framing denoising as self-supervised learning, we introduce a simple modification to our denoising loss with contrastive-inspired negative gradients, which is practical and yield additional improvements in generation quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Kuramoto Orientation Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15328v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Orientation-rich images, such as fingerprints and textures, often exhibit coherent angular directional patterns that are challenging to model using standard generative approaches based on isotropic Euclidean diffusion. Motivated by the role of phase synchronization in biological systems, we propose a score-based generative model built on periodic domains by leveraging stochastic Kuramoto dynamics in the diffusion process. In neural and physical systems, Kuramoto models capture synchronization phenomena across coupled oscillators -- a behavior that we re-purpose here as an inductive bias for structured image generation. In our framework, the forward process performs \textit{synchronization} among phase variables through globally or locally coupled oscillator interactions and attraction to a global reference phase, gradually collapsing the data into a low-entropy von Mises distribution. The reverse process then performs \textit{desynchronization}, generating diverse patterns by reversing the dynamics with a learned score function. This approach enables structured destruction during forward diffusion and a hierarchical generation process that progressively refines global coherence into fine-scale details. We implement wrapped Gaussian transition kernels and periodicity-aware networks to account for the circular geometry. Our method achieves competitive results on general image benchmarks and significantly improves generation quality on orientation-dense datasets like fingerprints and textures. Ultimately, this work demonstrates the promise of biologically inspired synchronization dynamics as structured priors in generative modeling.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[One Stone with Two Birds: A Null-Text-Null Frequency-Aware Diffusion Models for Text-Guided Image Inpainting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08273v5)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-guided image inpainting aims at reconstructing the masked regions as per text prompts, where the longstanding challenges lie in the preservation for unmasked regions, while achieving the semantics consistency between unmasked and inpainted masked regions. Previous arts failed to address both of them, always with either of them to be remedied. Such facts, as we observed, stem from the entanglement of the hybrid (e.g., mid-and-low) frequency bands that encode varied image properties, which exhibit different robustness to text prompts during the denoising process. In this paper, we propose a null-text-null frequency-aware diffusion models, dubbed \textbf{NTN-Diff}, for text-guided image inpainting, by decomposing the semantics consistency across masked and unmasked regions into the consistencies as per each frequency band, while preserving the unmasked regions, to circumvent two challenges in a row. Based on the diffusion process, we further divide the denoising process into early (high-level noise) and late (low-level noise) stages, where the mid-and-low frequency bands are disentangled during the denoising process. As observed, the stable mid-frequency band is progressively denoised to be semantically aligned during text-guided denoising process, which, meanwhile, serves as the guidance to the null-text denoising process to denoise low-frequency band for the masked regions, followed by a subsequent text-guided denoising process at late stage, to achieve the semantics consistency for mid-and-low frequency bands across masked and unmasked regions, while preserve the unmasked regions. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of NTN-Diff over the state-of-the-art diffusion models to text-guided diffusion models.

| **[Diffusion Beats Autoregressive in Data-Constrained Settings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15857v7)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive (AR) models have long dominated the landscape of large language models, driving progress across a wide range of tasks. Recently, diffusion-based language models have emerged as a promising alternative, though their advantages over AR models remain underexplored. In this paper, we systematically study masked diffusion models in data-constrained settings where training involves repeated passes over limited data and find that they significantly outperform AR models when compute is abundant but data is scarce. Diffusion models make better use of repeated data, achieving lower validation loss and superior downstream performance. We find new scaling laws for diffusion models and derive a closed-form expression for the critical compute threshold at which diffusion begins to outperform AR. Finally, we explain why diffusion models excel in this regime: their randomized masking objective implicitly trains over a rich distribution of token orderings, acting as an implicit data augmentation that AR's fixed left-to-right factorization lacks. Our results suggest that when data, not compute, is the bottleneck, diffusion models offer a compelling alternative to the standard AR paradigm.

However, prior diffusion models use a decoder-only architecture, which requires sampling algorithms that invoke the full network at every denoising step and incur high computational cost. Our key insight is that discrete diffusion models perform two types of computation: 1) representing clean tokens and 2) denoising corrupted tokens, which enables us to use separate modules for each task. We propose an encoder-decoder architecture to accelerate discrete diffusion inference, which relies on an encoder to represent clean tokens and a lightweight decoder to iteratively refine a noised sequence. We also show that this architecture enables faster training of block diffusion models, which partition sequences into blocks for better quality and are commonly used in diffusion language model inference. We introduce a framework for Efficient Encoder-Decoder Diffusion (E2D2), consisting of an architecture with specialized training and sampling algorithms, and we show that E2D2 achieves superior trade-offs between generation quality and inference throughput on summarization, translation, and mathematical reasoning tasks.

We introduce Semantic Surgery, a novel training-free, zero-shot framework for concept erasure that operates directly on text embeddings before the diffusion process. It dynamically estimates the presence of target concepts in a prompt and performs a calibrated vector subtraction to neutralize their influence at the source, enhancing both erasure completeness and locality. The framework includes a Co-Occurrence Encoding module for robust multi-concept erasure and a visual feedback loop to address latent concept persistence. As a training-free method, Semantic Surgery adapts dynamically to each prompt, ensuring precise interventions. Extensive experiments on object, explicit content, artistic style, and multi-celebrity erasure tasks show our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. We achieve superior completeness and robustness while preserving locality and image quality (e.g., 93.58 H-score in object erasure, reducing explicit content to just 1 instance, and 8.09 H_a in style erasure with no quality degradation). This robustness also allows our framework to function as a built-in threat detection system, offering a practical solution for safer text-to-image generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025).

| **[Clustering by Denoising: Latent plug-and-play diffusion for single-cell data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22835v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables the study of cellular heterogeneity. Yet, clustering accuracy, and with it downstream analyses based on cell labels, remain challenging due to measurement noise and biological variability. In standard latent spaces (e.g., obtained through PCA), data from different cell types can be projected close together, making accurate clustering difficult. We introduce a latent plug-and-play diffusion framework that separates the observation and denoising space. This separation is operationalized through a novel Gibbs sampling procedure: the learned diffusion prior is applied in a low-dimensional latent space to perform denoising, while to steer this process, noise is reintroduced into the original high-dimensional observation space. This unique "input-space steering" ensures the denoising trajectory remains faithful to the original data structure. Our approach offers three key advantages: (1) adaptive noise handling via a tunable balance between prior and observed data; (2) uncertainty quantification through principled uncertainty estimates for downstream analysis; and (3) generalizable denoising by leveraging clean reference data to denoise noisier datasets, and via averaging, improve quality beyond the training set. We evaluate robustness on both synthetic and real single-cell genomics data. Our method improves clustering accuracy on synthetic data across varied noise levels and dataset shifts. On real-world single-cell data, our method demonstrates improved biological coherence in the resulting cell clusters, with cluster boundaries that better align with known cell type markers and developmental trajectories.</p></details> |  |

Multi-fidelity frameworks address this challenge by combining inexpensive low-fidelity simulations with costly high-fidelity simulations to improve both accuracy and efficiency. However, certain scientific problems demand even more accurate results than the highest-fidelity simulations available, particularly when a tuning parameter controlling simulation accuracy is available, but the exact solution corresponding to a zero-valued parameter remains out of reach. In this paper, we introduce the Diffusion Non-Additive (DNA) model, inspired by generative diffusion models, which captures nonlinear dependencies across fidelity levels using Gaussian process priors and extrapolates to the exact solution. The DNA model: (i) accommodates complex, non-additive relationships across fidelity levels; (ii) employs a nonseparable covariance kernel to model interactions between the tuning parameter and input variables, improving both predictive performance and physical interpretability; and (iii) provides closed-form expressions for the posterior predictive mean and variance, allowing efficient inference and uncertainty quantification. The methodology is validated on a suite of numerical studies and real-world case studies. An R package implementing the proposed methodology is available to support practical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages including references and 22 pages supplementary</p></details> |

We extend classical denoising diffusion probabilistic models to free diffusion processes -- stochastic dynamics acting on noncommutative random variables whose spectral measures evolve by free additive convolution. The forward dynamics satisfy a free Fokker--Planck equation that increases Voiculescu's free entropy and dissipates free Fisher information, providing a noncommutative analogue of the classical de Bruijn identity. Using tools from free stochastic analysis, including a free Malliavin calculus and a Clark--Ocone representation, we derive the reverse-time stochastic differential equation driven by the conjugate variable, the free analogue of the score function. We further develop a variational formulation of these flows in the free Wasserstein space, showing that the resulting gradient-flow structure converges to the semicircular equilibrium law. Together, these results connect modern diffusion models with the information geometry of free entropy and establish a mathematical foundation for generative modeling with operator-valued or high-dimensional structured data.</p></details> |  |

An effective ambiguity set for DRO must involve distributions that remain consistent with the nominal distribution while being diverse enough to account for a variety of potential scenarios. Moreover, it should lead to tractable DRO solutions. To this end, we propose a diffusion-based ambiguity set design that captures various adversarial distributions beyond the nominal support space while maintaining consistency with the nominal distribution. Building on this ambiguity modeling, we propose Diffusion-based DRO (D-DRO), a tractable DRO algorithm that solves the inner maximization over the parameterized diffusion model space. We formally establish the stationary convergence performance of D-DRO and empirically demonstrate its superior Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization performance in a ML prediction task.</p></details> |  |

We present MARCD, a generative-to-decision framework with: (i) a Gaussian HMM to infer latent regimes; (ii) a diffusion generator that produces regime-conditioned scenarios; (iii) signal extraction via blended, shrunk moments; and (iv) a governed CVaR epigraph quadratic program. Contributions: Within the Scenario stage we introduce a tail-weighted diffusion objective that up-weights low-quantile outcomes relevant for drawdowns and a regime-expert (MoE) denoiser whose gate increases with crisis posteriors; both are evaluated end-to-end through the allocator. Under strict walk-forward on liquid multi-asset ETFs (2005-2025), MARCD exhibits stronger scenario calibration and materially smaller drawdowns: MaxDD 9.3% versus 14.1% for BL (a 34% reduction) over 2020-2025 out-of-sample. The framework provides an auditable pipeline with explicit budget, box, and turnover constraints, demonstrating the value of decision-aware generative modeling in finance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at: https://github.com/AliAtiah/MARCD</p></details> |

Although gradient-based solvers like DPM-Solver accelerate the denoising inference, they lack theoretical foundations in information transmission efficiency. In this work, we introduce an information-theoretic perspective on the inference processes of DMs, revealing that successful denoising fundamentally reduces conditional entropy in reverse transitions. This principle leads to our key insights into the inference processes: (1) data prediction parameterization outperforms its noise counterpart, and (2) optimizing conditional variance offers a reference-free way to minimize both transition and reconstruction errors. Based on these insights, we propose an entropy-aware variance optimized method for the generative process of DMs, called EVODiff, which systematically reduces uncertainty by optimizing conditional entropy during denoising. Extensive experiments on DMs validate our insights and demonstrate that our method significantly and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) gradient-based solvers. For example, compared to the DPM-Solver++, EVODiff reduces the reconstruction error by up to 45.5\% (FID improves from 5.10 to 2.78) at 10 function evaluations (NFE) on CIFAR-10, cuts the NFE cost by 25\% (from 20 to 15 NFE) for high-quality samples on ImageNet-256, and improves text-to-image generation while reducing artifacts.

A key step toward controllability is to identify interpretable directions in the model's latent representations that correspond to semantic attributes. Existing approaches for finding interpretable directions typically rely on sampling large sets of images or training auxiliary networks, which limits efficiency. We propose an analytical method that derives semantic editing directions directly from the pretrained parameters of diffusion models, requiring neither additional data nor fine-tuning. Our insight is that self-attention weight matrices encode rich structural information about the data distribution learned during training. By computing the eigenvectors of these weight matrices, we obtain robust and interpretable editing directions. Experiments demonstrate that our method produces high-quality edits across multiple datasets while reducing editing time significantly by 60% over current benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages (ICASSP Format)</p></details> |

Diffusion bridge models have recently shown promise in restoring clean images from their corresponding Filtered Back Projection (FBP) reconstructions, but incorporating data consistency into these models remains largely underexplored. Incorporating data consistency can improve reconstruction fidelity by aligning the reconstructed image with the observed projection data, and can enhance detail recovery by integrating structural information contained in the projections. In this work, we propose the Projection Embedded Diffusion Bridge (PEDB). PEDB introduces a novel reverse stochastic differential equation (SDE) to sample from the distribution of clean images conditioned on both the FBP reconstruction and the incomplete projection data. By explicitly conditioning on the projection data in sampling the clean images, PEDB naturally incorporates data consistency. We embed the projection data into the score function of the reverse SDE. Under certain assumptions, we derive a tractable expression for the posterior score. In addition, we introduce a free parameter to control the level of stochasticity in the reverse process. We also design a discretization scheme for the reverse SDE to mitigate discretization error. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PEDB achieves strong performance in CT reconstruction from three types of incomplete data, including sparse-view, limited-angle, and truncated projections. For each of these types, PEDB outperforms evaluated state-of-the-art diffusion bridge models across standard, noisy, and domain-shift evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>53 pa...</summary><p>53 pages, 7 figures, submitted to Medical Image Analysis</p></details> |

While these models have shown remarkable success across single-modality domains such as images and audio, extending their capabilities to Modality Translation (MT), translating information across different sensory modalities, remains an open challenge. Existing approaches often rely on restrictive assumptions, including shared dimensionality, Gaussian source priors, and modality-specific architectures, which limit their generality and theoretical grounding. In this work, we propose the Latent Denoising Diffusion Bridge Model (LDDBM), a general-purpose framework for modality translation based on a latent-variable extension of Denoising Diffusion Bridge Models. By operating in a shared latent space, our method learns a bridge between arbitrary modalities without requiring aligned dimensions. We introduce a contrastive alignment loss to enforce semantic consistency between paired samples and design a domain-agnostic encoder-decoder architecture tailored for noise prediction in latent space. Additionally, we propose a predictive loss to guide training toward accurate cross-domain translation and explore several training strategies to improve stability. Our approach supports arbitrary modality pairs and performs strongly on diverse MT tasks, including multi-view to 3D shape generation, image super-resolution, and multi-view scene synthesis. Comprehensive experiments and ablations validate the effectiveness of our framework, establishing a new strong baseline in general modality translation.

To address this issue, transfer learning has emerged as an essential paradigm in small data regimes. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical underpinnings of transfer learning conditional diffusion models remain unexplored. In this paper, we take the first step towards understanding the sample efficiency of transfer learning conditional diffusion models through the lens of representation learning. Inspired by practical training procedures, we assume that there exists a low-dimensional representation of conditions shared across all tasks. Our analysis shows that with a well-learned representation from source tasks, the samplecomplexity of target tasks can be reduced substantially. In addition, we investigate the practical implications of our theoretical results in several real-world applications of conditional diffusion models. Numerical experiments are also conducted to verify our results.</p></details> |  |

In the presence of stochastically-known logs, logs that contain probabilistic information, the need for stochastic trace recovery increases, to offer reliable means of understanding the processes that govern such systems. We design a novel deep learning approach for stochastic trace recovery, based on Diffusion Denoising Probabilistic Models (DDPM), which makes use of process knowledge (either implicitly by discovering a model or explicitly by injecting process knowledge in the training phase) to recover traces by denoising. We conduct an empirical evaluation demonstrating state-of-the-art performance with up to a 25% improvement over existing methods, along with increased robustness under high noise levels.</p></details> |  |
| **[Training-Free Safe Denoisers for Safe Use of Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08011v5)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is growing concern over the safety of powerful diffusion models (DMs), as they are often misused to produce inappropriate, not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content or generate copyrighted material or data of individuals who wish to be forgotten. Many existing methods tackle these issues by heavily relying on text-based negative prompts or extensively retraining DMs to eliminate certain features or samples. In this paper, we take a radically different approach, directly modifying the sampling trajectory by leveraging a negation set (e.g., unsafe images, copyrighted data, or datapoints needed to be excluded) to avoid specific regions of data distribution, without needing to retrain or fine-tune DMs. We formally derive the relationship between the expected denoised samples that are safe and those that are not safe, leading to our $\textit{safe}$ denoiser which ensures its final samples are away from the area to be negated. Inspired by the derivation, we develop a practical algorithm that successfully produces high-quality samples while avoiding negation areas of the data distribution in text-conditional, class-conditional, and unconditional image generation scenarios. These results hint at the great potential of our training-free safe denoiser for using DMs more safely.</p></details> | NeurIPS2025 |
| **[DMol: A Schedule-Driven Diffusion Model for Highly Efficient and Versatile Molecule Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06312v2)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a new graph diffusion model for small molecule generation, DMol, which outperforms the state-of-the-art DiGress model in terms of validity by roughly 1.5% across all benchmarking datasets while reducing the number of diffusion steps by at least 10-fold, and the running time to roughly one half. The performance improvements are a result of a careful change in the objective function and a graph noise scheduling approach which, at each diffusion step, allows one to only change a subset of nodes of varying size in the molecule graph. Another relevant property of the method is that it can be easily combined with junction-tree-like graph representations that arise by compressing a collection of relevant ring structures into supernodes. Unlike classical junction-tree techniques that involve VAEs and require complicated reconstruction steps, compressed DMol directly performs graph diffusion on a graph that compresses only a carefully selected set of frequent carbon rings into supernodes, which results in straightforward sample generation. This compressed DMol method offers additional validity improvements over generic DMol of roughly 2%, increases the novelty of the method, and further improves the running time due to reductions in the graph size.</p></details> |  |

We introduce ELBO-KTO, which combines an ELBO surrogate for diffusion log-likelihoods with a prospect-theoretic, unpaired preference objective (Kahneman Tversky Optimization, KTO). We analyze the bias and variance induced by the ELBO substitution and employ variance-reduction practices that stabilize gradients during training. Applied to LLaDA-8B-Instruct, ELBO-KTO yields \textbf{65.9\%} and \textbf{62.3\%} adjusted win rates on kto-mix-14k and UltraFeedback-Binary, respectively, versus the base model under an automatic LLM judge. Across downstream tasks, including GSM8K, MMLU, and additional reasoning/knowledge benchmarks, ELBO-KTO trained on UltraFeedback-Binary performs on par with or better than the base model under identical decoding. This establishes unpaired preference optimization as a viable alternative to pairwise alignment in diffusion LLMs.</p></details> |  |

The newly merged state D (delayable) represents users who have received the information but delayed its spreading and may eventually choose not to share it at all. Based on the mean-field approximation method, we derive the dynamical equations of the model and investigate its convergence and stability conditions. Under these conditions, we further propose an approximation algorithm for the edge-deletion problem, aiming to minimize the influence of information diffusion by identifying approximate solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dimension-free Score Matching and Time Bootstrapping for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10354v2)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models generate samples by estimating the score function of the target distribution at various noise levels. The model is trained using samples drawn from the target distribution by progressively adding noise. Previous sample complexity bounds have polynomial dependence on the dimension $d$, apart from a $\log(|\mathcal{H}|)$ term, where $\mathcal{H}$ is the hypothesis class. In this work, we establish the first (nearly) dimension-free sample complexity bounds, modulo the $\log(|\mathcal{H}|)$ dependence, for learning these score functions, achieving a double exponential improvement in the dimension over prior results. A key aspect of our analysis is the use of a single function approximator to jointly estimate scores across noise levels, a practical feature that enables generalization across time steps. We introduce a martingale-based error decomposition and sharp variance bounds, enabling efficient learning from dependent data generated by Markov processes, which may be of independent interest. Building on these insights, we propose Bootstrapped Score Matching (BSM), a variance reduction technique that leverages previously learned scores to improve accuracy at higher noise levels. These results provide insights into the efficiency and effectiveness of diffusion models for generative modeling.</p></details> |  |

Separate policies are developed for vertical and horizontal jumps, leveraging a simple yet effective strategy. First, we densify the inherently sparse jumping reward using the laws of projectile motion. Next, a reference state initialization scheme is employed to accelerate the exploration of dynamic jumping behaviors without reliance on reference trajectories. We also present a walking policy that, when combined with the jumping policies, unlocks versatile and dynamic locomotion capabilities. Comprehensive testing validates walking on varied terrain surfaces and jumping performance that exceeds previous works, effectively crossing the Sim2Real gap. Experimental validation demonstrates horizontal jumps up to 1.25 m with centimeter accuracy and vertical jumps up to 1.0 m. Additionally, we show that with only minor modifications, the proposed method can be used to learn omnidirectional jumping.</p></details> | 8 pages |

Despite this progress, many existing approaches rely on end-to-end deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which poses limitations in terms of safety and interpretability, especially when generalizing to novel terrains. To overcome these challenges, we introduce VOCALoco, a modular skill-selection framework that dynamically adapts locomotion strategies based on perceptual input. Given a set of pre-trained locomotion policies, VOCALoco evaluates their viability and energy-consumption by predicting both the safety of execution and the anticipated cost of transport over a fixed planning horizon. This joint assessment enables the selection of policies that are both safe and energy-efficient, given the observed local terrain. We evaluate our approach on staircase locomotion tasks, demonstrating its performance in both simulated and real-world scenarios using a quadrupedal robot. Empirical results show that VOCALoco achieves improved robustness and safety during stair ascent and descent compared to a conventional end-to-end DRL policy</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RAL), 2025. 8 pages, 9 figures</p></details> |

Unlike many musical instruments, our work allows individuals of all skill levels to effortlessly create music by walking into virtual bubbles. Our Augmented Reality experience involves interacting with ever-shifting sound bubbles that the user engages with by stepping into color-coded bubbles within the assigned area using a standalone AR headset. Each bubble corresponds to a cello note, and omits sound from the center of the bubble, and lets the user hear and express in spatial audio, effectively transforming participants into musicians. This interactive element enables users to explore the intersection of spatial awareness, musical rhythm that extends to bodily expression through playful movements and dance-like gestures within the bubble-filled environment. This unique experience illuminates the intricate relationship between spatial awareness and the art of musical performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended Abstracts (Interactivity), 5 pages.

| **[Step2Motion: Locomotion Reconstruction from Pressure Sensing Insoles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22712v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human motion is fundamentally driven by continuous physical interaction with the environment. Whether walking, running, or simply standing, the forces exchanged between our feet and the ground provide crucial insights for understanding and reconstructing human movement. Recent advances in wearable insole devices offer a compelling solution for capturing these forces in diverse, real-world scenarios. Sensor insoles pose no constraint on the users' motion (unlike mocap suits) and are unaffected by line-of-sight limitations (in contrast to optical systems). These qualities make sensor insoles an ideal choice for robust, unconstrained motion capture, particularly in outdoor environments. Surprisingly, leveraging these devices with recent motion reconstruction methods remains largely unexplored. Aiming to fill this gap, we present Step2Motion, the first approach to reconstruct human locomotion from multi-modal insole sensors. Our method utilizes pressure and inertial data-accelerations and angular rates-captured by the insoles to reconstruct human motion. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach across a range of experiments to show its versatility for diverse locomotion styles, from simple ones like walking or jogging up to moving sideways, on tiptoes, slightly crouching, or dancing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Locomotion and Motion Imitation for Humanoid Policy Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14305v3)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans exhibit diverse and expressive whole-body movements. However, attaining human-like whole-body coordination in humanoid robots remains challenging, as conventional approaches that mimic whole-body motions often neglect the distinct roles of upper and lower body. This oversight leads to computationally intensive policy learning and frequently causes robot instability and falls during real-world execution. To address these issues, we propose Adversarial Locomotion and Motion Imitation (ALMI), a novel framework that enables adversarial policy learning between upper and lower body. Specifically, the lower body aims to provide robust locomotion capabilities to follow velocity commands while the upper body tracks various motions. Conversely, the upper-body policy ensures effective motion tracking when the robot executes velocity-based movements. Through iterative updates, these policies achieve coordinated whole-body control, which can be extended to loco-manipulation tasks with teleoperation systems. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves robust locomotion and precise motion tracking in both simulation and on the full-size Unitree H1 robot. Additionally, we release a large-scale whole-body motion control dataset featuring high-quality episodic trajectories from MuJoCo simulations deployable on real robots.

| **[Load-bearing Assessment for Safe Locomotion of Quadruped Robots on Collapsing Terrain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21369v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collapsing terrains, often present in search and rescue missions or planetary exploration, pose significant challenges for quadruped robots. This paper introduces a robust locomotion framework for safe navigation over unstable surfaces by integrating terrain probing, load-bearing analysis, motion planning, and control strategies. Unlike traditional methods that rely on specialized sensors or external terrain mapping alone, our approach leverages joint measurements to assess terrain stability without hardware modifications. A Model Predictive Control (MPC) system optimizes robot motion, balancing stability and probing constraints, while a state machine coordinates terrain probing actions, enabling the robot to detect collapsible regions and dynamically adjust its footholds. Experimental results on custom-made collapsing platforms and rocky terrains demonstrate the framework's ability to traverse collapsing terrain while maintaining stability and prioritizing safety.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement Learning-based Robust Wall Climbing Locomotion Controller in Ferromagnetic Environment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20174v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a reinforcement learning framework for quadrupedal wall-climbing locomotion that explicitly addresses uncertainty in magnetic foot adhesion. A physics-based adhesion model of a quadrupedal magnetic climbing robot is incorporated into simulation to capture partial contact, air-gap sensitivity, and probabilistic attachment failures. To stabilize learning and enable reliable transfer, we design a three-phase curriculum: (1) acquire a crawl gait on flat ground without adhesion, (2) gradually rotate the gravity vector to vertical while activating the adhesion model, and (3) inject stochastic adhesion failures to encourage slip recovery. The learned policy achieves a high success rate, strong adhesion retention, and rapid recovery from detachment in simulation under degraded adhesion. Compared with a model predictive control (MPC) baseline that assumes perfect adhesion, our controller maintains locomotion when attachment is intermittently lost. Hardware experiments with the untethered robot further confirm robust vertical crawling on steel surfaces, maintaining stability despite transient misalignment and incomplete attachment. These results show that combining curriculum learning with realistic adhesion modeling provides a resilient sim-to-real framework for magnetic climbing robots in complex environments.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Towards An Adaptive Locomotion Strategy For Quadruped Rovers: Quantifying When To Slide Or Walk On Planetary Slopes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18678v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Legged rovers provide enhanced mobility compared to wheeled platforms, enabling navigation on steep and irregular planetary terrains. However, traditional legged locomotion might be energetically inefficient and potentially dangerous to the rover on loose and inclined surfaces, such as crater walls and cave slopes. This paper introduces a preliminary study that compares the Cost of Transport (CoT) of walking and torso-based sliding locomotion for quadruped robots across different slopes, friction conditions and speed levels. By identifying intersections between walking and sliding CoT curves, we aim to define threshold conditions that may trigger transitions between the two strategies. The methodology combines physics-based simulations in Isaac Sim with particle interaction validation in ANSYS-Rocky. Our results represent an initial step towards adaptive locomotion strategies for planetary legged rovers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at the 18th Symposium on Advanced Space Technologies in Robotics and Automation (ASTRA 2025)</p></details> |
| **[PGTT: Phase-Guided Terrain Traversal for Perceptive Legged Locomotion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18348v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art perceptive Reinforcement Learning controllers for legged robots either (i) impose oscillator or IK-based gait priors that constrain the action space, add bias to the policy optimization and reduce adaptability across robot morphologies, or (ii) operate "blind", which struggle to anticipate hind-leg terrain, and are brittle to noise. In this paper, we propose Phase-Guided Terrain Traversal (PGTT), a perception-aware deep-RL approach that overcomes these limitations by enforcing gait structure purely through reward shaping, thereby reducing inductive bias in policy learning compared to oscillator/IK-conditioned action priors. PGTT encodes per-leg phase as a cubic Hermite spline that adapts swing height to local heightmap statistics and adds a swing-phase contact penalty, while the policy acts directly in joint space supporting morphology-agnostic deployment. Trained in MuJoCo (MJX) on procedurally generated stair-like terrains with curriculum and domain randomization, PGTT achieves the highest success under push disturbances (median +7.5% vs. the next best method) and on discrete obstacles (+9%), with comparable velocity tracking, and converging to an effective policy roughly 2x faster than strong end-to-end baselines. We validate PGTT on a Unitree Go2 using a real-time LiDAR elevation-to-heightmap pipeline, and we report preliminary results on ANYmal-C obtained with the same hyperparameters. These findings indicate that terrain-adaptive, phase-guided reward shaping is a simple and general mechanism for robust perceptive locomotion across platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[LIPM-Guided Reinforcement Learning for Stable and Perceptive Locomotion in Bipedal Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09106v2)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving stable and robust perceptive locomotion for bipedal robots in unstructured outdoor environments remains a critical challenge due to complex terrain geometry and susceptibility to external disturbances. In this work, we propose a novel reward design inspired by the Linear Inverted Pendulum Model (LIPM) to enable perceptive and stable locomotion in the wild. The LIPM provides theoretical guidance for dynamic balance by regulating the center of mass (CoM) height and the torso orientation. These are key factors for terrain-aware locomotion, as they help ensure a stable viewpoint for the robot's camera. Building on this insight, we design a reward function that promotes balance and dynamic stability while encouraging accurate CoM trajectory tracking. To adaptively trade off between velocity tracking and stability, we leverage the Reward Fusion Module (RFM) approach that prioritizes stability when needed. A double-critic architecture is adopted to separately evaluate stability and locomotion objectives, improving training efficiency and robustness. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on a bipedal robot in both simulation and real-world outdoor environments. The results demonstrate superior terrain adaptability, disturbance rejection, and consistent performance across a wide range of speeds and perceptual conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Architecture Is All You Need: Diversity-Enabled Sweet Spots for Robust Humanoid Locomotion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14947v2)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust humanoid locomotion in unstructured environments requires architectures that balance fast low-level stabilization with slower perceptual decision-making. We show that a simple layered control architecture (LCA), a proprioceptive stabilizer running at high rate, coupled with a compact low-rate perceptual policy, enables substantially more robust performance than monolithic end-to-end designs, even when using minimal perception encoders. Through a two-stage training curriculum (blind stabilizer pretraining followed by perceptual fine-tuning), we demonstrate that layered policies consistently outperform one-stage alternatives in both simulation and hardware. On a Unitree G1 humanoid, our approach succeeds across stair and ledge tasks where one-stage perceptual policies fail. These results highlight that architectural separation of timescales, rather than network scale or complexity, is the key enabler for robust perception-conditioned locomotion.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[From Language to Locomotion: Retargeting-free Humanoid Control via Motion Latent Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14952v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural language offers a natural interface for humanoid robots, but existing language-guided humanoid locomotion pipelines remain cumbersome and untrustworthy. They typically decode human motion, retarget it to robot morphology, and then track it with a physics-based controller. However, this multi-stage process is prone to cumulative errors, introduces high latency, and yields weak coupling between semantics and control. These limitations call for a more direct pathway from language to action, one that eliminates fragile intermediate stages. Therefore, we present RoboGhost, a retargeting-free framework that directly conditions humanoid policies on language-grounded motion latents. By bypassing explicit motion decoding and retargeting, RoboGhost enables a diffusion-based policy to denoise executable actions directly from noise, preserving semantic intent and supporting fast, reactive control. A hybrid causal transformer-diffusion motion generator further ensures long-horizon consistency while maintaining stability and diversity, yielding rich latent representations for precise humanoid behavior. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoboGhost substantially reduces deployment latency, improves success rates and tracking precision, and produces smooth, semantically aligned locomotion on real humanoids. Beyond text, the framework naturally extends to other modalities such as images, audio, and music, providing a universal foundation for vision-language-action humanoid systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Legged Locomotion via Online Learning for Model Predictive Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15626v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We provide an algorithm for adaptive legged locomotion via online learning and model predictive control. The algorithm is composed of two interacting modules: model predictive control (MPC) and online learning of residual dynamics. The residual dynamics can represent modeling errors and external disturbances. We are motivated by the future of autonomy where quadrupeds will autonomously perform complex tasks despite real-world unknown uncertainty, such as unknown payload and uneven terrains. The algorithm uses random Fourier features to approximate the residual dynamics in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Then, it employs MPC based on the current learned model of the residual dynamics. The model is updated online in a self-supervised manner using least squares based on the data collected while controlling the quadruped. The algorithm enjoys sublinear \textit{dynamic regret}, defined as the suboptimality against an optimal clairvoyant controller that knows how the residual dynamics. We validate our algorithm in Gazebo and MuJoCo simulations, where the quadruped aims to track reference trajectories. The Gazebo simulations include constant unknown external forces up to $12\boldsymbol{g}$, where $\boldsymbol{g}$ is the gravity vector, in flat terrain, slope terrain with $20\degree$ inclination, and rough terrain with $0.25m$ height variation. The MuJoCo simulations include time-varying unknown disturbances with payload up to $8~kg$ and time-varying ground friction coefficients in flat terrain.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Risk-Aware Reinforcement Learning with Bandit-Based Adaptation for Quadrupedal Locomotion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14338v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we study risk-aware reinforcement learning for quadrupedal locomotion. Our approach trains a family of risk-conditioned policies using a Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) constrained policy optimization technique that provides improved stability and sample efficiency. At deployment, we adaptively select the best performing policy from the family of policies using a multi-armed bandit framework that uses only observed episodic returns, without any privileged environment information, and adapts to unknown conditions on the fly. Hence, we train quadrupedal locomotion policies at various levels of robustness using CVaR and adaptively select the desired level of robustness online to ensure performance in unknown environments. We evaluate our method in simulation across eight unseen settings (by changing dynamics, contacts, sensing noise, and terrain) and on a Unitree Go2 robot in previously unseen terrains. Our risk-aware policy attains nearly twice the mean and tail performance in unseen environments compared to other baselines and our bandit-based adaptation selects the best-performing risk-aware policy in unknown terrain within two minutes of operation.</p></details> |  |

This study introduces a novel approach to enhance quadruped locomotion robustness by training the Unitree Go2 robot on an oscillating bridge - a 13.24-meter steel-and-concrete structure with a 2.0 Hz eigenfrequency designed to perturb locomotion. Using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm in a MuJoCo simulation, we trained 15 distinct locomotion policies, combining five gaits (trot, pace, bound, free, default) with three training conditions: rigid bridge and two oscillating bridge setups with differing height regulation strategies (relative to bridge surface or ground). Domain randomization ensured zero-shot transfer to the real-world bridge. Our results demonstrate that policies trained on the oscillating bridge exhibit superior stability and adaptability compared to those trained on rigid surfaces. Our framework enables robust gait patterns even without prior bridge exposure. These findings highlight the potential of simulation-based RL to improve quadruped locomotion during dynamic ground perturbations, offering insights for designing robots capable of traversing vibrating environments.</p></details> |  |

To emulate human walking, robots need to step on the positions they see in unknown spaces accurately. In this paper, we present PolyMap, a perception-based locomotion planning framework for humanoid robots to climb stairs. Our core idea is to build a real-time polygonal staircase plane semantic map, followed by a footstep planar using these polygonal plane segments. These plane segmentation and visual odometry are done by multi-sensor fusion(LiDAR, RGB-D camera and IMUs). The proposed framework is deployed on a NVIDIA Orin, which performs 20-30 Hz whole-body motion planning output. Both indoor and outdoor real-scene experiments indicate that our method is efficient and robust for humanoid robot stair climbing.</p></details> |  |

However, such imitation learning approaches predominantly capture explicit kinematic patterns, so-called gaits, while overlooking the implicit passive dynamics. This work bridges this gap by incorporating a reward term guided by Impact Mitigation Factor (IMF), a physics-informed metric that quantifies a robot's ability to passively mitigate impacts. By integrating IMF with AMP, our approach enables RL policies to learn both explicit motion trajectories from animal reference motion and the implicit passive dynamic. We demonstrate energy efficiency improvements of up to 32%, as measured by the Cost of Transport (CoT), across both AMP and handcrafted reward structure.</p></details> |  |
| **[Preference-Conditioned Multi-Objective RL for Integrated Command Tracking and Force Compliance in Humanoid Locomotion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10851v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humanoid locomotion requires not only accurate command tracking for navigation but also compliant responses to external forces during human interaction. Despite significant progress, existing RL approaches mainly emphasize robustness, yielding policies that resist external forces but lack compliance-particularly challenging for inherently unstable humanoids. In this work, we address this by formulating humanoid locomotion as a multi-objective optimization problem that balances command tracking and external force compliance. We introduce a preference-conditioned multi-objective RL (MORL) framework that integrates rigid command following and compliant behaviors within a single omnidirectional locomotion policy. External forces are modeled via velocity-resistance factor for consistent reward design, and training leverages an encoder-decoder structure that infers task-relevant privileged features from deployable observations. We validate our approach in both simulation and real-world experiments on a humanoid robot. Experimental results indicate that our framework not only improves adaptability and convergence over standard pipelines, but also realizes deployable preference-conditioned humanoid locomotion.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gain Tuning Is Not What You Need: Reward Gain Adaptation for Constrained Locomotion Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10759v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing robot locomotion learning techniques rely heavily on the offline selection of proper reward weighting gains and cannot guarantee constraint satisfaction (i.e., constraint violation) during training. Thus, this work aims to address both issues by proposing Reward-Oriented Gains via Embodied Regulation (ROGER), which adapts reward-weighting gains online based on penalties received throughout the embodied interaction process. The ratio between the positive reward (primary reward) and negative reward (penalty) gains is automatically reduced as the learning approaches the constraint thresholds to avoid violation. Conversely, the ratio is increased when learning is in safe states to prioritize performance. With a 60-kg quadruped robot, ROGER achieved near-zero constraint violation throughout multiple learning trials. It also achieved up to 50% more primary reward than the equivalent state-of-the-art techniques. In MuJoCo continuous locomotion benchmarks, including a single-leg hopper, ROGER exhibited comparable or up to 100% higher performance and 60% less torque usage and orientation deviation compared to those trained with the default reward function. Finally, real-world locomotion learning of a physical quadruped robot was achieved from scratch within one hour without any falls. Therefore, this work contributes to constraint-satisfying real-world continual robot locomotion learning and simplifies reward weighting gain tuning, potentially facilitating the development of physical robots and those that learn in the real world.</p></details> | RSS 2025 |

In this paper, we present ATRos, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based hybrid locomotion framework to achieve hybrid walking-driving motions on the wheeled-legged robot. Without giving predefined gait patterns, our planner aims to intelligently coordinate simultaneous wheel and leg movements, thereby achieving improved terrain adaptability and improved energy efficiency. Based on RL techniques, our approach constructs a prediction policy network that could estimate external environmental states from proprioceptive sensory information, and the outputs are then fed into an actor critic network to produce optimal joint commands. The feasibility of the proposed framework is validated through both simulations and real-world experiments across diverse terrains, including flat ground, stairs, and grassy surfaces. The hybrid locomotion framework shows robust performance over various unseen terrains, highlighting its generalization capability.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 2 figures, submitted to IROS 2025 wheeled-legged workshop</p></details> |

However, terrain-aware humanoid locomotion remains largely constrained to two paradigms: depth image-based end-to-end learning and elevation map-based methods. The former suffers from limited training efficiency and a significant sim-to-real gap in depth perception, while the latter depends heavily on multiple vision sensors and localization systems, resulting in latency and reduced robustness. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel framework that tightly integrates three key components: (1) Terrain-Aware Locomotion Policy with a Blind Backbone, which leverages pre-trained elevation map-based perception to guide reinforcement learning with minimal visual input; (2) Multi-Modality Cross-Attention Transformer, which reconstructs structured terrain representations from noisy depth images; (3) Realistic Depth Images Synthetic Method, which employs self-occlusion-aware ray casting and noise-aware modeling to synthesize realistic depth observations, achieving over 30\% reduction in terrain reconstruction error. This combination enables efficient policy training with limited data and hardware resources, while preserving critical terrain features essential for generalization. We validate our framework on a full-sized humanoid robot, demonstrating agile and adaptive locomotion across diverse and challenging terrains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantifying Locomotion Differences Between Virtual Reality Users With and Without Motor Impairments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07987v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Today's virtual reality (VR) systems and environments assume that users have typical abilities, which can make VR inaccessible to people with physical impairments. However, there is not yet an understanding of how inaccessible locomotion techniques are, and which interactions make them inaccessible. To this end, we conducted a study in which people with and without upper-body impairments navigated a virtual environment with six locomotion techniques to quantify performance differences among groups. We found that groups performed similarly with Sliding Looking on all performance measures, suggesting that this might be a good default locomotion technique for VR apps. To understand the nature of performance differences with the other techniques, we collected low-level interaction data from the controllers and headset and analyzed interaction differences with a set of movement-, button-, and target-related metrics. We found that movement-related metrics from headset data reveal differences among groups with all techniques, suggesting these are good metrics for identifying whether a user has an upper-body impairment. We also identify movement-, button, and target-related metrics that can explain performance differences between groups for particular locomotion techniques.</p></details> | 34 pages, 24 figures |

We investigate the effects of sampling physical robot parameters and joint proportional-derivative gains to enable training a single reinforcement learning policy that generalizes to multiple parameter configurations. Three fundamental joint gain sampling strategies are compared: parameter sampling with (1) linear and polynomial function mappings of mass-to-gains, (2) performance-based adaptive filtering, and (3) uniform random sampling. We improve the robustness of the policy by biasing the configurations using nominal priors and reference models. All training was conducted on RaiSim, tested in simulation on a range of diverse quadrupeds, and zero-shot deployed onto hardware using the ANYmal quadruped robot. Compared to multiple baseline implementations, our results demonstrate the need for significant joint controller gains randomization for robust closing of the sim-to-real gap.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Crawl: Latent Model-Based Reinforcement Learning for Soft Robotic Adaptive Locomotion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05957v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Soft robotic crawlers are mobile robots that utilize soft body deformability and compliance to achieve locomotion through surface contact. Designing control strategies for such systems is challenging due to model inaccuracies, sensor noise, and the need to discover locomotor gaits. In this work, we present a model-based reinforcement learning (MB-RL) framework in which latent dynamics inferred from onboard sensors serve as a predictive model that guides an actor-critic algorithm to optimize locomotor policies. We evaluate the framework on a minimal crawler model in simulation using inertial measurement units and time-of-flight sensors as observations. The learned latent dynamics enable short-horizon motion prediction while the actor-critic discovers effective locomotor policies. This approach highlights the potential of latent-dynamics MB-RL for enabling embodied soft robotic adaptive locomotion based solely on noisy sensor feedback.</p></details> |  |
| **[Locability: An Ability-Based Ranking Model for Virtual Reality Locomotion Techniques](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05679v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There are over a hundred virtual reality (VR) locomotion techniques that exist today, with new ones being designed as VR technology evolves. The different ways of controlling locomotion techniques (e.g., gestures, button inputs, body movements), along with the diversity of upper-body motor impairments, can make it difficult for a user to know which locomotion technique is best suited to their particular abilities. Moreover, trial-and-error can be difficult, time-consuming, and costly. Using machine learning techniques and data from 20 people with and without upper-body motor impairments, we developed a modeling approach to predict a ranked list of a user's fastest techniques based on questionnaire and interaction data. We found that a user's fastest technique could be predicted based on interaction data with 92% accuracy and that predicted locomotion times were within 12% of observed times. The model we trained could also rank six locomotion techniques based on speed with 61% accuracy and that predictions were within 8% of observed times. Our findings contribute to growing research in VR accessibility by taking an ability-based design approach to adapt systems to users' abilities.</p></details> | 36 pages, 11 figures |

TARS3D translates the block-shaped 'TARS' robot from Interstellar into a 0.25 m, 0.99 kg research platform with seven actuated degrees of freedom. The film shows two primary gaits: a bipedal-like walk and a high-speed rolling mode. For TARS3D, we build reduced-order models for each, derive closed-form limit-cycle conditions, and validate the predictions on hardware. Experiments confirm that the robot respects its +/-150 degree hip limits, alternates left-right contacts without interference, and maintains an eight-step hybrid limit cycle in rolling mode. Because each telescopic leg provides four contact corners, the rolling gait is modeled as an eight-spoke double rimless wheel. The robot's telescopic leg redundancy implies a far richer gait repertoire than the two limit cycles treated analytically. So, we used deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in simulation to search the unexplored space. We observed that the learned policy can recover the analytic gaits under the right priors and discover novel behaviors as well. Our findings show that TARS3D's fiction-inspired bio-transcending morphology can realize multiple previously unexplored locomotion modes and that further learning-driven search is likely to reveal more. This combination of analytic synthesis and reinforcement learning opens a promising pathway for multimodal robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 10 figures.

However, visual information is inherently fragile, being vulnerable to occlusions, reflections, and lighting changes, which often cause instability in locomotion. Inspired by animal sensorimotor integration, we propose KiVi, a Kinesthetic-Visuospatial integration framework, where kinesthetics encodes proprioceptive sensing of body motion and visuospatial reasoning captures visual perception of surrounding terrain. Specifically, KiVi separates these pathways, leveraging proprioception as a stable backbone while selectively incorporating vision for terrain awareness and obstacle avoidance. This modality-balanced, yet integrative design, combined with memory-enhanced attention, allows the robot to robustly interpret visual cues while maintaining fallback stability through proprioception. Extensive experiments show that our method enables quadruped robots to stably traverse diverse terrains and operate reliably in unstructured outdoor environments, remaining robust to out-of-distribution (OOD) visual noise and occlusion unseen during training, thereby highlighting its effectiveness and applicability to real-world legged locomotion.</p></details> |  |
| **[Flexible Locomotion Learning with Diffusion Model Predictive Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04234v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Legged locomotion demands controllers that are both robust and adaptable, while remaining compatible with task and safety considerations. However, model-free reinforcement learning (RL) methods often yield a fixed policy that can be difficult to adapt to new behaviors at test time. In contrast, Model Predictive Control (MPC) provides a natural approach to flexible behavior synthesis by incorporating different objectives and constraints directly into its optimization process. However, classical MPC relies on accurate dynamics models, which are often difficult to obtain in complex environments and typically require simplifying assumptions. We present Diffusion-MPC, which leverages a learned generative diffusion model as an approximate dynamics prior for planning, enabling flexible test-time adaptation through reward and constraint based optimization. Diffusion-MPC jointly predicts future states and actions; at each reverse step, we incorporate reward planning and impose constraint projection, yielding trajectories that satisfy task objectives while remaining within physical limits. To obtain a planning model that adapts beyond imitation pretraining, we introduce an interactive training algorithm for diffusion based planner: we execute our reward-and-constraint planner in environment, then filter and reweight the collected trajectories by their realized returns before updating the denoiser. Our design enables strong test-time adaptability, allowing the planner to adjust to new reward specifications without retraining. We validate Diffusion-MPC on real world, demonstrating strong locomotion and flexible adaptation.</p></details> | 9 pages, 8 figures |

Existing online planar mapping approaches struggle to balance accuracy and computational efficiency: direct depth image segmentation from specific sensors suffers from poor temporal integration, height map-based methods cannot represent complex 3D structures like overhangs, and voxel-based plane segmentation remains unexplored for real-time applications. To address these limitations, we develop a novel framework that integrates vertex-based connected component labeling with random sample consensus based plane detection and convex hull, leveraging GPU parallel computing to rapidly extract planar regions from point clouds accumulated in high-resolution 3D voxel maps. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves fast and accurate 3D multi-plane segmentation at over 30 Hz update rate even at a resolution of 0.01 m, enabling the detected planes to be utilized in real time for locomotion tasks. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments in both simulated environments and physical legged robot platforms, confirming robust locomotion performance when considering 3D planar structures.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 12 figures, This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

While there exists a wide variety of legged platforms such as quadruped, humanoids, and hexapods, the field is still missing a single learning framework that can control all these different embodiments easily and effectively and possibly transfer, zero or few-shot, to unseen robot embodiments. We introduce URMA, the Unified Robot Morphology Architecture, to close this gap. Our framework brings the end-to-end Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning approach to the realm of legged robots, enabling the learned policy to control any type of robot morphology. The key idea of our method is to allow the network to learn an abstract locomotion controller that can be seamlessly shared between embodiments thanks to our morphology-agnostic encoders and decoders. This flexible architecture can be seen as a potential first step in building a foundation model for legged robot locomotion. Our experiments show that URMA can learn a locomotion policy on multiple embodiments that can be easily transferred to unseen robot platforms in simulation and the real world.</p></details> |  |

We present LocoFormer, a generalist omni-bodied locomotion model that can control previously unseen legged and wheeled robots, even without precise knowledge of their kinematics. LocoFormer is able to adapt to changes in morphology and dynamics at test time. We find that two key choices enable adaptation. First, we train massive scale RL on procedurally generated robots with aggressive domain randomization. Second, in contrast to previous policies that are myopic with short context lengths, we extend context by orders of magnitude to span episode boundaries. We deploy the same LocoFormer to varied robots and show robust control even with large disturbances such as weight change and motor failures. In extreme scenarios, we see emergent adaptation across episodes, LocoFormer learns from falls in early episodes to improve control strategies in later ones. We believe that this simple, yet general recipe can be used to train foundation models for other robotic skills in the future.

While DRL has significantly advanced bipedal locomotion, the development of a unified framework capable of handling a wide range of tasks remains an ongoing challenge. This survey systematically categorises, compares, and analyses existing DRL frameworks for bipedal locomotion, organising them into end-to-end and hierarchical control schemes. End-to-end frameworks are evaluated based on their learning approaches, while hierarchical frameworks are examined in terms of layered structures that integrate learning-based or traditional model-based methods. We provide a detailed evaluation of the composition, strengths, limitations, and capabilities of each framework. Additionally, this survey identifies key research gaps and proposes future directions aimed at creating a more integrated and efficient framework for bipedal locomotion, with wide-ranging applications in real-world environments.</p></details> | 17 pages, 8 figures |
| **[SAC-Loco: Safe and Adjustable Compliant Quadrupedal Locomotion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23223v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quadruped robots are designed to achieve agile locomotion by mimicking legged animals. However, existing control methods for quadrupeds often lack one of the key capabilities observed in animals: adaptive and adjustable compliance in response to external disturbances. Most locomotion controllers do not provide tunable compliance and tend to fail under large perturbations. In this work, we propose a switched policy framework for compliant and safe quadruped locomotion. First, we train a force compliant policy with adjustable compliance levels using a teacher student reinforcement learning framework, eliminating the need for explicit force sensing. Next, we develop a safe policy based on the capture point concept to stabilize the robot when the compliant policy fails. Finally, we introduce a recoverability network that predicts the likelihood of failure and switches between the compliant and safe policies. Together, this framework enables quadruped robots to achieve both force compliance and robust safety when subjected to severe external disturbances.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimized Fish Locomotion using Design-by-Morphing and Bayesian Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00044v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents a computational framework for optimizing undulatory swimming profiles using a combination of design-by-morphing and Bayesian optimization strategies. The body deformation is expressed as a linear combination of five baseline bio-inspired profiles, including two unconventional shapes to enhance diversity in the design space. The optimization objective is to maximize propulsive efficiency over a wide range of frequency-wavelength combinations. The Arbitrary Lagrangian--Eulerian formulation is employed to simulate the unsteady flow around two-dimensional undulating swimmers. The optimized profile achieves a significantly improved efficiency of 82.4\%, while the second- and third-best profiles achieve efficiencies of 51.8\% and 42.8\%, respectively, outperforming the benchmark anguilliform and carangiform profiles by leveraging advantageous surface stress distributions and effective energy recovery mechanisms. A detailed force decomposition reveals that the optimal swimmer minimizes resistive drag and maximizes constructive work contributions, particularly in the anterior and posterior body regions. Spatial and temporal work decomposition indicates a strategic redistribution of input and recovered energy, enhancing performance while reducing energetic cost. The wake topology associated with the optimized swimmer exhibits organized and coherent vortex structures, reflecting superior fluid-structure interaction characteristics compared to conventional profiles. These findings demonstrate that morphing-based parametric design, when guided by surrogate-assisted optimization, offers a powerful framework for discovering energetically efficient swimming gaits, with significant implications for the design of autonomous underwater propulsion systems and the broader field of bio-inspired locomotion.</p></details> |  |
| **[Physically-Feasible Reactive Synthesis for Terrain-Adaptive Locomotion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23185v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present an integrated planning framework for quadrupedal locomotion over dynamically changing, unforeseen terrains. Existing methods often depend on heuristics for real-time foothold selection-limiting robustness and adaptability-or rely on computationally intensive trajectory optimization across complex terrains and long horizons. In contrast, our approach combines reactive synthesis for generating correct-by-construction symbolic-level controllers with mixed-integer convex programming (MICP) for dynamic and physically feasible footstep planning during each symbolic transition. To reduce the reliance on costly MICP solves and accommodate specifications that may be violated due to physical infeasibility, we adopt a symbolic repair mechanism that selectively generates only the required symbolic transitions. During execution, real-time MICP replanning based on actual terrain data, combined with runtime symbolic repair and delay-aware coordination, enables seamless bridging between offline synthesis and online operation. Through extensive simulation and hardware experiments, we validate the framework's ability to identify missing locomotion skills and respond effectively in safety-critical environments, including scattered stepping stones and rebar scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods can learn motion behaviors from expert data, but they often fail to acquire multiple locomotion skills through a single policy and lack smooth skill transitions. We propose a multi-skill learning framework based on Conditional Adversarial Motion Priors (CAMP), with the aim of enabling quadruped robots to efficiently acquire a diverse set of locomotion skills from expert demonstrations. Precise skill reconstruction is achieved through a novel skill discriminator and skill-conditioned reward design. The overall framework supports the active control and reuse of multiple skills, providing a practical solution for learning generalizable policies in complex environments.</p></details> |  |

Existing deep reinforcement learning methods typically require the policy to directly track a reference motion, forcing a single policy to simultaneously learn motion imitation, velocity tracking, and stability maintenance. To address this, we introduce RuN, a novel decoupled residual learning framework. RuN decomposes the control task by pairing a pre-trained Conditional Motion Generator, which provides a kinematically natural motion prior, with a reinforcement learning policy that learns a lightweight residual correction to handle dynamical interactions. Experiments in simulation and reality on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot demonstrate that RuN achieves stable, natural gaits and smooth walk-run transitions across a broad velocity range (0-2.5 m/s), outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both training efficiency and final performance.</p></details> |  |

This is due to a lack of understanding of how to control 3-D body bending to push against terrain features to generate and control propulsion. Biological studies suggested that generalist snakes use contact force sensing to adjust body bending in real time to do so. However, studying this sensory-modulated force control in snakes is challenging, due to a lack of basic knowledge of how their force sensing organs work. Here, we take a robophysics approach to make progress, starting by developing a snake robot capable of 3-D body bending with contact force sensing to enable systematic locomotion experiments and force measurements. Through two development and testing iterations, we created a 12-segment robot with 36 piezo-resistive sheet sensors distributed on all segments with compliant shells with a sampling frequency of 30 Hz. The robot measured contact forces while traversing a large obstacle using vertical bending with high repeatability, achieving the goal of providing a platform for systematic experiments. Finally, we explored model-based calibration considering the viscoelastic behavior of the piezo-resistive sensor, which will for useful for future studies.</p></details> |  |

In the first stage, a compact 4-DOF (four-degree-of-freedom) reduced-order model (ROM) is trained via Proximal Policy Optimization. This generates energy-efficient gait templates. In the second stage, those dynamically consistent trajectories guide a full-body policy trained with Soft Actor--Critic augmented by an adversarial discriminator, ensuring the student's five-dimensional gait feature distribution matches the ROM's demonstrations. Experiments at 1 meter-per-second and 4 meter-per-second show that ROM-GRL produces stable, symmetric gaits with substantially lower tracking error than a pure-reward baseline. By distilling lightweight ROM guidance into high-dimensional policies, ROM-GRL bridges the gap between reward-only and imitation-based locomotion methods, enabling versatile, naturalistic humanoid behaviors without any human demonstrations.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, 1 table, Computational Science Graduate Project</p></details> |

In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved notable success in training robust locomotion policies over diverse terrain, yet it lacks guarantees of constraint satisfaction and often requires substantial reward shaping. Recent efforts in combining MPC and RL have shown promise of taking the best of both worlds, but they are primarily restricted to flat terrain or quadrupedal robots. In this work, we propose an RL-augmented MPC framework tailored for bipedal locomotion over rough and slippery terrain. Our method parametrizes three key components of single-rigid-body-dynamics-based MPC: system dynamics, swing leg controller, and gait frequency. We validate our approach through bipedal robot simulations in NVIDIA IsaacLab across various terrains, including stairs, stepping stones, and low-friction surfaces. Experimental results demonstrate that our RL-augmented MPC framework produces significantly more adaptive and robust behaviors compared to baseline MPC and RL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Shape-induced obstacle attraction and repulsion during dynamic locomotion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.08176v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots still struggle to dynamically traverse complex 3-D terrain with many large obstacles, an ability required for many critical applications. Body-obstacle interaction is often inevitable and induces perturbation and uncertainty in motion that challenges closed-form dynamic modeling. Here, inspired by recent discovery of a terradynamic streamlined shape, we studied how two body shapes interacting with obstacles affect turning and pitching motions of an open-loop multi-legged robot and cockroaches during dynamic locomotion. With a common cuboidal body, the robot was attracted towards obstacles, resulting in pitching up and flipping-over. By contrast, with an elliptical body, the robot was repelled by obstacles and readily traversed. The animal displayed qualitatively similar turning and pitching motions induced by these two body shapes. However, unlike the cuboidal robot, the cuboidal animal was capable of escaping obstacle attraction and subsequent high pitching and flipping over, which inspired us to develop an empirical pitch-and-turn strategy for cuboidal robots. Considering the similarity of our self-propelled body-obstacle interaction with part-feeder interaction in robotic part manipulation, we developed a quasi-static potential energy landscape model to explain the dependence of dynamic locomotion on body shape. Our experimental and modeling results also demonstrated that obstacle attraction or repulsion is an inherent property of locomotor body shape and insensitive to obstacle geometry and size. Our study expanded the concept and usefulness of terradynamic shapes for passive control of robot locomotion to traverse large obstacles using physical interaction. Our study is also a step in establishing an energy landscape approach to locomotor transitions.</p></details> |  |

Instead of mainly relying on domain randomization (DR) to best cover the real environments and thereby close the sim-to-real gap and enhance robustness, this work proposes an emerging decoupled framework that acquires fast online adaptation ability and mitigates the sim-to-real problems in unfamiliar environments by isolating stance-leg control and swing-leg control. Various simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate its effectiveness against horizontal force disturbances, uneven terrains, heavy and biased payloads, and sim-to-real gap.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contrastive Representation Learning for Robust Sim-to-Real Transfer of Adaptive Humanoid Locomotion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12858v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning has produced remarkable advances in humanoid locomotion, yet a fundamental dilemma persists for real-world deployment: policies must choose between the robustness of reactive proprioceptive control or the proactivity of complex, fragile perception-driven systems. This paper resolves this dilemma by introducing a paradigm that imbues a purely proprioceptive policy with proactive capabilities, achieving the foresight of perception without its deployment-time costs. Our core contribution is a contrastive learning framework that compels the actor's latent state to encode privileged environmental information from simulation. Crucially, this ``distilled awareness" empowers an adaptive gait clock, allowing the policy to proactively adjust its rhythm based on an inferred understanding of the terrain. This synergy resolves the classic trade-off between rigid, clocked gaits and unstable clock-free policies. We validate our approach with zero-shot sim-to-real transfer to a full-sized humanoid, demonstrating highly robust locomotion over challenging terrains, including 30 cm high steps and 26.5{\deg} slopes, proving the effectiveness of our method.

To address these limitations, we present PerchMobi^3, a quad-fan, negative-pressure, air-ground-wall robot that implements a propulsion-adhesion power-reuse mechanism. By repurposing four ducted fans to simultaneously provide aerial thrust and negative-pressure adhesion, and integrating them with four actively driven wheels, PerchMobi^3 eliminates dedicated pumps while maintaining a lightweight and compact design. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first quad-fan prototype to demonstrate functional power reuse for multi-modal locomotion. A modeling and control framework enables coordinated operation across ground, wall, and aerial domains with fan-assisted transitions. The feasibility of the design is validated through a comprehensive set of experiments covering ground driving, payload-assisted wall climbing, aerial flight, and cross-mode transitions, demonstrating robust adaptability across locomotion scenarios.

| **[Gait-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning with Multi-Phase Curriculum for Humanoid Locomotion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20619v3)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a unified gait-conditioned reinforcement learning framework that enables humanoid robots to perform standing, walking, running, and smooth transitions within a single recurrent policy. A compact reward routing mechanism dynamically activates gait-specific objectives based on a one-hot gait ID, mitigating reward interference and supporting stable multi-gait learning. Human-inspired reward terms promote biomechanically natural motions, such as straight-knee stance and coordinated arm-leg swing, without requiring motion capture data. A structured curriculum progressively introduces gait complexity and expands command space over multiple phases. In simulation, the policy successfully achieves robust standing, walking, running, and gait transitions. On the real Unitree G1 humanoid, we validate standing, walking, and walk-to-stand transitions, demonstrating stable and coordinated locomotion. This work provides a scalable, reference-free solution toward versatile and naturalistic humanoid control across diverse modes and environments.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by ontogenetic scaling of muscle power in biology, we propose Scaling Mechanical Output over Lifetime (SMOL), a novel curriculum that dynamically modulates robot actuator strength to mimic natural variations in power-to-weight ratio during growth and ageing. Integrating SMOL into the MAP-Elites quality-diversity framework, we vary the torque in standard robotics tasks to mimic the evolution of strength in animals as they grow up and as their body changes. Through comprehensive empirical evaluation, we show that the SMOL schedule consistently elevates both performance and diversity of locomotion behaviours across varied control scenarios, by allowing agents to leverage advantageous physics early on to discover skills that act as stepping stones when they reach their final standard body properties. Based on studies of the total power output in humans, we also implement the SMOL-Human schedule that models isometric body variations due to non-linear changes like puberty, and study its impact on robotics locomotion.</p></details> |  |

We present a model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) framework that improves sample efficiency for quadrupedal locomotion by appending synthetic data to the end of standard rollouts in PPO-based controllers, following the Dyna-Style paradigm. A predictive model, trained alongside the policy, generates short-horizon synthetic transitions that are gradually integrated using a scheduling strategy based on the policy update iterations. Through an ablation study, we identified a strong correlation between sample efficiency and rollout length, which guided the design of our experiments. We validated our approach in simulation on the Unitree Go1 robot and showed that replacing part of the simulated steps with synthetic ones not only mimics extended rollouts but also improves policy return and reduces variance. Finally, we demonstrate that this improvement transfers to the ability to track a wide range of locomotion commands using fewer simulated steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters. 8 pages</p></details> |

However, integrating locomotion skills with navigation in quadrupedal robots has not been fully investigated, which holds promise for enhancing long-distance movement capabilities. In this paper, we propose Skill-Nav, a method that incorporates quadrupedal locomotion skills into a hierarchical navigation framework using waypoints as an interface. Specifically, we train a waypoint-guided locomotion policy using deep RL, enabling the robot to autonomously adjust its locomotion skills to reach targeted positions while avoiding obstacles. Compared with direct velocity commands, waypoints offer a simpler yet more flexible interface for high-level planning and low-level control. Utilizing waypoints as the interface allows for the application of various general planning tools, such as large language models (LLMs) and path planning algorithms, to guide our locomotion policy in traversing terrains with diverse obstacles. Extensive experiments conducted in both simulated and real-world scenarios demonstrate that Skill-Nav can effectively traverse complex terrains and complete challenging navigation tasks.</p></details> | 17pages, 6 figures |

This paper presents a computationally efficient hierarchical control framework for humanoid robot locomotion based on reduced-order models -- enabling versatile step planning and incorporating arm and torso dynamics to better stabilize the walking. At the high level, we use the step-to-step dynamics of the ALIP model to simultaneously optimize over step periods, step lengths, and ankle torques via nonlinear MPC. The ALIP trajectories are used as references to a linear MPC framework that extends the standard SRB-MPC to also include simplified arm and torso dynamics. We validate the performance of our approach through simulation and hardware experiments on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot. In the proposed framework the high-level step planner runs at 40 Hz and the mid-level MPC at 500 Hz using the onboard mini-PC. Adaptive step timing increased the push recovery success rate by 36%, and the upper body control improved the yaw disturbance rejection. We also demonstrate robust locomotion across diverse indoor and outdoor terrains, including grass, stone pavement, and uneven gym mats.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, accepted to IEEE-RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robots 2025</p></details> |

In this work, we introduce a novel learning framework for effectively training a humanoid locomotion policy that imitates the behavior of a model-based controller while extending its capabilities to handle more complex locomotion tasks, such as more challenging terrain and higher velocity commands. Our framework consists of three key components: pre-training through imitation of the model-based controller, fine-tuning via reinforcement learning, and model-assumption-based regularization (MAR) during fine-tuning. In particular, MAR aligns the policy with actions from the model-based controller only in states where the model assumption holds to prevent catastrophic forgetting. We evaluate the proposed framework through comprehensive simulation tests and hardware experiments on a full-size humanoid robot, Digit, demonstrating a forward speed of 1.5 m/s and robust locomotion across diverse terrains, including slippery, sloped, uneven, and sandy terrains.</p></details> |  |

Application of neuromorphic computing in robotic locomotion research have largely focused on Central Pattern Generators (CPGs) for bionics robotic control algorithms - inspired from neural circuits governing the collaboration of the limb muscles in animal movement. Implementation of artificial CPGs on neuromorphic hardware platforms can potentially enable adaptive and energy-efficient edge robotics applications in resource constrained environments. However, underlying rewiring mechanisms in CPG for gait emergence process is not well understood. This work addresses the missing gap in literature pertaining to CPG plasticity and underscores the critical homeostatic functionality of astrocytes - a cellular component in the brain that is believed to play a major role in multiple brain functions. This paper introduces an astrocyte regulated Spiking Neural Network (SNN)-based CPG for learning locomotion gait through Reward-Modulated STDP for quadruped robots, where the astrocytes help build inhibitory connections among the artificial motor neurons in different limbs. The SNN-based CPG is simulated on a multi-object physics simulation platform resulting in the emergence of a trotting gait while running the robot on flat ground. $23.3\times$ computational power savings is observed in comparison to a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning based robot control algorithm. Such a neuroscience-algorithm co-design approach can potentially enable a quantum leap in the functionality of neuromorphic systems incorporating glial cell functionality.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Layered Control Perspective on Legged Locomotion: Embedding Reduced Order Models via Hybrid Zero Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00294v1)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reduced-order models (ROMs) provide a powerful means of synthesizing dynamic walking gaits on legged robots. Yet this approach lacks the formal guarantees enjoyed by methods that utilize the full-order model (FOM) for gait synthesis, e.g., hybrid zero dynamics. This paper aims to unify these approaches through a layered control perspective. In particular, we establish conditions on when a ROM of locomotion yields stable walking on the full-order hybrid dynamics. To achieve this result, given an ROM we synthesize a zero dynamics manifold encoding the behavior of the ROM -- controllers can be synthesized that drive the FOM to this surface, yielding hybrid zero dynamics. We prove that a stable periodic orbit in the ROM implies an input-to-state stable periodic orbit of the FOM's hybrid zero dynamics, and hence the FOM dynamics. This result is demonstrated in simulation on a linear inverted pendulum ROM and a 5-link planar walking FOM.</p></details> |  |

We investigate embodiment scaling laws, the hypothesis that increasing the number of training embodiments improves generalization to unseen ones, using robot locomotion as a test bed. We procedurally generate ~1,000 embodiments with topological, geometric, and joint-level kinematic variations, and train policies on random subsets. We observe positive scaling trends supporting the hypothesis, and find that embodiment scaling enables substantially broader generalization than data scaling on fixed embodiments. Our best policy, trained on the full dataset, transfers zero-shot to novel embodiments in simulation and the real world, including the Unitree Go2 and H1. These results represent a step toward general embodied intelligence, with relevance to adaptive control for configurable robots, morphology co-design, and beyond.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL), 2025.

Depth-based perception approaches often struggle with sensor noise, lighting variability, computational overhead from intermediate representations (e.g., elevation maps), and difficulties with non-planar obstacles, limiting performance in unstructured environments. In contrast, direct integration of LiDAR sensing into end-to-end learning for legged locomotion remains underexplored. We propose Omni-Perception, an end-to-end locomotion policy that achieves 3D spatial awareness and omnidirectional collision avoidance by directly processing raw LiDAR point clouds. At its core is PD-RiskNet (Proximal-Distal Risk-Aware Hierarchical Network), a novel perception module that interprets spatio-temporal LiDAR data for environmental risk assessment. To facilitate efficient policy learning, we develop a high-fidelity LiDAR simulation toolkit with realistic noise modeling and fast raycasting, compatible with platforms such as Isaac Gym, Genesis, and MuJoCo, enabling scalable training and effective sim-to-real transfer. Learning reactive control policies directly from raw LiDAR data enables the robot to navigate complex environments with static and dynamic obstacles more robustly than approaches relying on intermediate maps or limited sensing. We validate Omni-Perception through real-world experiments and extensive simulation, demonstrating strong omnidirectional avoidance capabilities and superior locomotion performance in highly dynamic environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Deployable Locomotion Control via Differentiable Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02887v2)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable simulators promise to improve sample efficiency in robot learning by providing analytic gradients of the system dynamics. Yet, their application to contact-rich tasks like locomotion is complicated by the inherently non-smooth nature of contact, impeding effective gradient-based optimization. Existing works thus often rely on soft contact models that provide smooth gradients but lack physical accuracy, constraining results to simulation. To address this limitation, we propose a differentiable contact model designed to provide informative gradients while maintaining high physical fidelity. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by training a quadrupedal locomotion policy within our differentiable simulator leveraging analytic gradients and successfully transferring the learned policy zero-shot to the real world. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first successful sim-to-real transfer of a legged locomotion policy learned entirely within a differentiable simulator, establishing the feasibility of using differentiable simulation for real-world locomotion control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 9th Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL 2025), Seoul, Korea</p></details> |

Like the Jacob's Ladder toy, FlipWalker features two interconnected segments joined by flexible cables, enabling it to pivot and flip around singularities in a manner reminiscent of the toy's cascading motion. Actuation is provided by motor-driven legs within each segment that push off either the ground or the opposing segment, depending on the robot's current configuration. A physics-based model of the underactuated flipping dynamics is formulated to elucidate the critical design parameters governing forward motion and obstacle clearance or climbing. The untethered prototype weighs 0.78 kg, achieves a maximum flipping speed of 0.2 body lengths per second. Experimental trials on artificial grass, river rocks, and snow demonstrate that FlipWalker's flipping strategy, which relies on ground reaction forces applied normal to the surface, offers a promising alternative to traditional locomotion for navigating irregular outdoor terrain.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2025)</p></details> |

Building on recent published work [1], we demonstrate here, for the first time, that microrobotic smartlets, hitherto buoyancy divers, can also be equipped to navigate in 2D on surfaces, with on-board control responding to both sensor information and their internal electronic program. Fabricating modular microrobots, with all dimensions of 1mm and below, has been difficult to achieve because of competing demands for the limited surface area and the challenges of integrating and interconnecting the diverse functionalities of energy harvesting, actuation, sensing, communication, docking and control. A novel high density heterogeneous integration, via soft-substrate micro flip-chip bonding of custom CMOS and LED microchiplets onto fold-up polymer surfaces, compatible with roll-up isotropic ambient light harvesting, now makes this possible. Fabricating electrolytic bubble actuators on multiple cube-faces and connecting them to a custom sensor-controlled on-board microchiplet (lablet), allows the smartlets to locomote on wet surfaces, changing direction in response to both timed programmed control as well as programmed response to locally sensed signals. Such locomoted robotic microcubes can also move to and selectively dock with other modules via patterned surfaces. This is powered by ambient light in natural aqueous media on smooth surfaces.</p></details> |  |

The hybrid nature of the system introduces a combination of discrete and continuous variables which causes issues for numerical optimal control. To address these challenges, we propose a layered architecture that separates the choice of discrete variables and a smooth Model Predictive Controller (MPC). The layered formulation allows for online flexibility and optimality without sacrificing real-time performance through a combination of gradient-free and gradient-based methods. The architecture leverages a sampling-based method for determining discrete variables, and a classical smooth MPC formulation using these fixed discrete variables. We demonstrate the results on a quadrupedal robot stepping over gaps and onto terrain with varying heights. In simulation, we demonstrate the controller on a humanoid robot for gap traversal. The layered approach is shown to be more optimal and reliable than common heuristic-based approaches and faster to compute than pure sampling methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Humanoids 2025</p></details> |

However, planning such motions requires solving a highly challenging optimization problem with a mixture of continuous and discrete decision variables. In this paper, we present a full pipeline based on Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) and whole-body trajectory optimization (TO) to perform simultaneous contact sequence and patch selection on highly challenging environments. Through extensive simulation experiments, we show that our framework can quickly find a diverse set of dynamically consistent plans. We experimentally show that these plans are transferable to a real quadruped robot. We further show that the same framework can find highly complex acyclic humanoid maneuvers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of simultaneous contact sequence and patch selection for acyclic multi-contact locomotion using the whole-body dynamics of a quadruped.</p></details> |  |

This necessitates omnidirectional terrain sensing and a controller capable of processing such input. We present a learning framework for vision-based omnidirectional bipedal locomotion, enabling seamless movement using depth images. A key challenge is the high computational cost of rendering omnidirectional depth images in simulation, making traditional sim-to-real reinforcement learning (RL) impractical. Our method combines a robust blind controller with a teacher policy that supervises a vision-based student policy, trained on noise-augmented terrain data to avoid rendering costs during RL and ensure robustness. We also introduce a data augmentation technique for supervised student training, accelerating training by up to 10 times compared to conventional methods. Our framework is validated through simulation and real-world tests, demonstrating effective omnidirectional locomotion with minimal reliance on expensive rendering. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first demonstration of vision-based omnidirectional bipedal locomotion, showcasing its adaptability to diverse terrains.</p></details> |  |

To be practical, these transitions must be fast, robust, and energy efficient. While learning-based locomotion has made significant progress, most existing methods optimize for velocity-tracking rather than direct pose reaching, resulting in inefficient, marching-style behavior when applied to short-range tasks. In this work, we develop a reinforcement learning approach that directly optimizes humanoid locomotion for SE(2) targets. Central to this approach is a new constellation-based reward function that encourages natural and efficient target-oriented movement. To evaluate performance, we introduce a benchmarking framework that measures energy consumption, time-to-target, and footstep count on a distribution of SE(2) goals. Our results show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms standard methods and enables successful transfer from simulation to hardware, highlighting the importance of targeted reward design for practical short-range humanoid locomotion.</p></details> |  |

Existing musculoskeletal models typically oversimplify foot-ground contact mechanics, limiting their ability to accurately simulate human gait dynamics. We developed a novel contact-rich and deformable model of the human foot integrated within a complete musculoskeletal system that captures the complex biomechanical interactions during walking. To overcome the control challenges inherent in modeling multi-point contacts and deformable material, we developed a two-stage policy training strategy to learn natural walking patterns for this interface-enhanced model. Comparative analysis between our approach and conventional rigid musculoskeletal models demonstrated improvements in kinematic, kinetic, and gait stability metrics. Validation against human subject data confirmed that our simulation closely reproduced real-world biomechanical measurements.

However, key challenges such as representation misalignment between privileged teacher and proprioceptive-only student, covariate shift due to behavioral cloning, and lack of deployable adaptation; lead to poor generalization in real-world scenarios. We propose Teacher-Aligned Representations via Contrastive Learning (TAR), a framework that leverages privileged information with self-supervised contrastive learning to bridge this gap. By aligning representations to a privileged teacher in simulation via contrastive objectives, our student policy learns structured latent spaces and exhibits robust generalization to Out-of-Distribution (OOD) scenarios, surpassing the fully privileged "Teacher". Results showed accelerated training by 2x compared to state-of-the-art baselines to achieve peak performance. OOD scenarios showed better generalization by 40% on average compared to existing methods. Moreover, TAR transitions seamlessly into learning during deployment without requiring privileged states, setting a new benchmark in sample-efficient, adaptive locomotion and enabling continual fine-tuning in real-world scenarios.

Using the T-LEAP pose estimation model, the motion of nine keypoints was extracted from videos of walking cows. The videos were recorded outdoors, with varying illumination conditions, and T-LEAP extracted 99.6% of correct keypoints. The trajectories of the keypoints were then used to compute six locomotion traits: back posture measurement, head bobbing, tracking distance, stride length, stance duration, and swing duration. The three most important traits were back posture measurement, head bobbing, and tracking distance. For the ground truth, we showed that a thoughtful merging of the scores of the observers could improve intra-observer reliability and agreement. We showed that including multiple locomotion traits improves the classification accuracy from 76.6% with only one trait to 79.9% with the three most important traits and to 80.1% with all six locomotion traits.</p></details> |  |

While most existing methods typically employ single-agent reinforcement learning algorithms for a single humanoid robot or MARL algorithms for multi-robot system tasks, we propose a distinct paradigm: applying cooperative-heterogeneous MARL to optimize locomotion for a single humanoid robot. The proposed method, multi-agent reinforcement learning for single humanoid locomotion (MASH), treats each limb (legs and arms) as an independent agent that explores the robot's action space while sharing a global critic for cooperative learning. Experiments demonstrate that MASH accelerates training convergence and improves whole-body cooperation ability, outperforming conventional single-agent reinforcement learning methods. This work advances the integration of MARL into single-humanoid-robot control, offering new insights into efficient locomotion strategies.</p></details> |  |

In crawl spaces, current exteroceptive locomotion learning methods are limited by large noises and errors of the sensors in possible low visibility conditions, and current proprioceptive locomotion learning methods are difficult in traversing crawl spaces because only ground features are inferred. In this study, a point cloud supervised proprioceptive locomotion reinforcement learning method for legged robots in crawl spaces is proposed. A state estimation network is designed to estimate the robot's surrounding ground and spatial features as well as the robot's collision states using historical proprioceptive sensor data. The point cloud is represented in polar coordinate frame and a point cloud processing method is proposed to efficiently extract the ground and spatial features that are used to supervise the state estimation network learning. Comprehensive reward functions that guide the robot to traverse through crawl spaces after collisions are designed. Experiments demonstrate that, compared to existing methods, our method exhibits more agile locomotion in crawl spaces. This study enhances the ability of legged robots to traverse spatially constrained environments without requiring exteroceptive sensors.</p></details> |  |

However, their effects on non-steady locomotion, characterized by nonlinear phase progression within a gait cycle, remain insufficiently explored, particularly across diverse activities. This work presents a shank angle-based control system that enables the exoskeleton to maintain real-time coordination with human gait, even under phase perturbations, while dynamically shaping assistance profiles to match the biological ankle moment patterns across walking, running, stair negotiation tasks. The control system consists of an assistance profile online generation method and a model-based feedforward control method. The assistance profile is formulated as a dual-Gaussian model with the shank angle as the independent variable. Leveraging only IMU measurements, the model parameters are updated online each stride to adapt to inter- and intra-individual biomechanical variability. The profile tracking control employs a human-exoskeleton kinematics and stiffness model as a feedforward component, reducing reliance on historical control data due to the lack of clear and consistent periodicity in non-steady locomotion. Three experiments were conducted using a lightweight soft exoskeleton with multiple subjects. The results validated the effectiveness of each individual method, demonstrated the robustness of the control system against gait perturbations across various activities, and revealed positive biomechanical and physiological responses of human users to the exoskeleton's mechanical assistance.</p></details> | <details><summary>49 pa...</summary><p>49 pages, 20 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

However, such exploration is inherently challenging, and we often rely on extensive reward engineering, expert demonstrations, or curriculum learning - all of which limit generalizability. In this work, we propose Skill Discovery as Exploration (SDAX), a novel learning framework that significantly reduces human engineering effort. SDAX leverages unsupervised skill discovery to autonomously acquire a diverse repertoire of skills for overcoming obstacles. To dynamically regulate the level of exploration during training, SDAX employs a bi-level optimization process that autonomously adjusts the degree of exploration. We demonstrate that SDAX enables quadrupedal robots to acquire highly agile behaviors including crawling, climbing, leaping, and executing complex maneuvers such as jumping off vertical walls. Finally, we deploy the learned policy on real hardware, validating its successful transfer to the real world.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference on Robot Learning 2025</p></details> |

While prior work focused on learning simple forward gaits, our framework extends on-robot learning to omnidirectional locomotion. We demonstrate the robustness of our approach in different indoor and outdoor environments.</p></details> |  |

Current reinforcement learning approaches are often limited by blind controllers that lack environmental awareness or by vision-based systems that fail to perceive complex 3D obstacles. In this work, we present an end-to-end locomotion policy that directly maps raw, spatio-temporal LiDAR point clouds to motor commands, enabling robust navigation in cluttered dynamic scenes. We formulate the control problem as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) to formally separate safety from task objectives. Our key contribution is a novel methodology that translates the principles of Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) into costs within the CMDP, allowing a model-free Penalized Proximal Policy Optimization (P3O) to enforce safety constraints during training. Furthermore, we introduce a set of comfort-oriented rewards, grounded in human-robot interaction research, to promote motions that are smooth, predictable, and less intrusive. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework through a successful sim-to-real transfer to a physical humanoid robot, which exhibits agile and safe navigation around both static and dynamic 3D obstacles.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we introduce an in-between motion generation based multi-style quadruped robot locomotion framework. We propose a CVAE based motion generator, synthesizing multi-style dynamically feasible locomotion sequences between arbitrary start and end states. By embedding physical constraints and leveraging joint poses based phase manifold continuity, this component produces physically plausible motions spanning multiple gait modalities while ensuring kinematic compatibility with robotic morphologies. We train the imitation policy based on generated data, which validates the effectiveness of generated motion data in enhancing controller stability and improving velocity tracking performance. The proposed framework demonstrates significant improvements in velocity tracking and deployment stability. We successfully deploy the framework on a real-world quadruped robot, and the experimental validation confirms the framework's capability to generate and execute complex motion profiles, including gallop, tripod, trotting and pacing.</p></details> |  |

We take a modular approach where the high-level planner commands the target position and orientation of the hands and eyes of the humanoid, delivered by the low-level policy that controls the whole-body movements. Specifically, the low-level whole-body controller learns to track the three points (eyes, left hand, and right hand) from existing large-scale human motion capture data while high-level policy learns from human data collected by Aria glasses. Our modular approach decouples the ego-centric vision perception from physical actions, promoting efficient learning and scalability to novel scenes. We evaluate our method both in simulation and in the real-world, demonstrating humanoid's capabilities to navigate and reach in complex environments designed for humans.</p></details> |  |

Unlike conventional quadrupeds, its joint actuators and thrusters enable enhanced control authority, facilitating thruster-assisted narrow-path walking. While a unified Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework optimizing both ground reaction forces and thruster forces could theoretically address this control problem, its feasibility is limited by the low torque-control bandwidth of the system's lightweight actuators. To overcome this challenge, we propose a decoupled control architecture: a Raibert-type controller governs legged locomotion using position-based control, while an MPC regulates the thrusters augmented by learned Contact Residual Dynamics (CRD) to account for leg-ground impacts. This separation bypasses the torque-control rate bottleneck while retaining the thruster MPC to explicitly account for leg-ground impact dynamics through learned residuals. We validate this approach through both simulation and hardware experiments, showing that the decoupled control architecture with CRD performs more stable behavior in terms of push recovery and cat-like walking gait compared to the decoupled controller without CRD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimal Trajectory Planning in a Vertically Undulating Snake Locomotion using Contact-implicit Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02953v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contact-rich problems, such as snake robot locomotion, offer unexplored yet rich opportunities for optimization-based trajectory and acyclic contact planning. So far, a substantial body of control research has focused on emulating snake locomotion and replicating its distinctive movement patterns using shape functions that either ignore the complexity of interactions or focus on complex interactions with matter (e.g., burrowing movements). However, models and control frameworks that lie in between these two paradigms and are based on simple, fundamental rigid body dynamics, which alleviate the challenging contact and control allocation problems in snake locomotion, remain absent. This work makes meaningful contributions, substantiated by simulations and experiments, in the following directions: 1) introducing a reduced-order model based on Moreau's stepping-forward approach from differential inclusion mathematics, 2) verifying model accuracy, 3) experimental validation.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a modular robotic system in which each module has independent actuation, battery power, and control, allowing both individual mobility and coordinated locomotion. A hierarchical Central Pattern Generator (CPG) framework governs motion, with a low-level CPG controlling individual modules and a high-level CPG synchronizing inter-module coordination, enabling smooth transitions between independent and collective behaviors. To validate the system, we conduct simulations in MuJoCo and hardware experiments, evaluating locomotion across different configurations. We first analyze single-module motion, followed by two-module cooperative locomotion. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the CPG-based control framework in achieving robust, flexible, and scalable locomotion. The proposed modular architecture has potential applications in search and rescue, environmental monitoring, and autonomous exploration, where adaptability and reconfigurability are essential.</p></details> |  |

We present a methodology that leverages Constraints-as-Terminations and domain randomization techniques to enable sim-to-real transfer. Through a series of qualitative and quantitative experiments, we evaluate our approach in terms of balance maintenance, velocity control, and responses to slip and push disturbances.

| **[Friction-Aware Safety Locomotion for Wheeled-legged Robots using Vision Language Models and Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09845v2)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Controlling Wheeled-legged robots is challenging especially on slippery surfaces due to their dependence on continuous ground contact. Unlike quadrupeds or bipeds, which can leverage multiple fixed contact points for recovery, wheeled-legged robots are highly susceptible to slip, where even momentary loss of traction can result in irrecoverable instability. Anticipating ground physical properties such as friction before contact would allow proactive control adjustments, reducing slip risk. In this paper, we propose a friction-aware safety locomotion framework that integrates Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with a Reinforcement Learning (RL) policy. Our method employs a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to estimate the Coefficient of Friction (CoF), which is then explicitly incorporated into the RL policy. This enables the robot to adapt its speed based on predicted friction conditions before contact. The framework is validated through experiments in both simulation and on a physical customized Wheeled Inverted Pendulum (WIP). Experimental results show that our approach successfully completes trajectory tracking tasks on slippery surfaces, whereas baseline methods relying solely on proprioceptive feedback fail. These findings highlight the importance and effectiveness of explicitly predicting and utilizing ground friction information for safe locomotion. They also point to a promising research direction in exploring the use of VLMs for estimating ground conditions, which remains a significant challenge for purely vision-based methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Humanoids 2025</p></details> |

The adoption of deep Reinforcement Learning (RL), transformers and various knowledge transfer techniques can greatly reduce the sim-to-real gap. However, the classical teacher-student framework commonly used in existing locomotion policies requires a pre-trained teacher and leverages the privilege information to guide the student policy. With the implementation of large-scale models in robotics controllers, especially transformers-based ones, this knowledge distillation technique starts to show its weakness in efficiency, due to the requirement of multiple supervised stages. In this paper, we propose Unified Locomotion Transformer (ULT), a new transformer-based framework to unify the processes of knowledge transfer and policy optimization in a single network while still taking advantage of privilege information. The policies are optimized with reinforcement learning, next state-action prediction, and action imitation, all in just one training stage, to achieve zero-shot deployment. Evaluation results demonstrate that with ULT, optimal teacher and student policies can be obtained at the same time, greatly easing the difficulty in knowledge transfer, even with complex transformer-based models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for IROS 2025.

By utilizing a modular structure and selecting the appropriate learning-based method for each residual module, our framework demonstrates improved control performance in environments with high uncertainty, while also achieving higher learning efficiency compared to baseline methods. Moreover, we observed that our proposed methodology not only enhances control performance but also provides additional benefits, such as making nominal controllers more robust to parameter tuning.

Currently, most research focuses on proprioception-based methods, which lack the capability to overcome complex terrain. While visual perception is vital for operation in human-centric environments, its integration complicates control further. Recent reinforcement learning (RL) approaches have shown promise in enhancing legged robot locomotion, particularly with proprioception-based methods. However, terrain adaptability, especially for bipedal robots, remains a significant challenge, with most research focusing on flat-terrain scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel mixture of experts teacher-student network RL strategy, which enhances the performance of teacher-student policies based on visual inputs through a simple yet effective approach. Our method combines terrain selection strategies with the teacher policy, resulting in superior performance compared to traditional models. Additionally, we introduce an alignment loss between the teacher and student networks, rather than enforcing strict similarity, to improve the student's ability to navigate diverse terrains. We validate our approach experimentally on the Limx Dynamic P1 bipedal robot, demonstrating its feasibility and robustness across multiple terrain types.</p></details> |  |
| **[Iteratively Learning Muscle Memory for Legged Robots to Master Adaptive and High Precision Locomotion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13662v1)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a scalable and adaptive control framework for legged robots that integrates Iterative Learning Control (ILC) with a biologically inspired torque library (TL), analogous to muscle memory. The proposed method addresses key challenges in robotic locomotion, including accurate trajectory tracking under unmodeled dynamics and external disturbances. By leveraging the repetitive nature of periodic gaits and extending ILC to nonperiodic tasks, the framework enhances accuracy and generalization across diverse locomotion scenarios. The control architecture is data-enabled, combining a physics-based model derived from hybrid-system trajectory optimization with real-time learning to compensate for model uncertainties and external disturbances. A central contribution is the development of a generalized TL that stores learned control profiles and enables rapid adaptation to changes in speed, terrain, and gravitational conditions-eliminating the need for repeated learning and significantly reducing online computation. The approach is validated on the bipedal robot Cassie and the quadrupedal robot A1 through extensive simulations and hardware experiments. Results demonstrate that the proposed framework reduces joint tracking errors by up to 85% within a few seconds and enables reliable execution of both periodic and nonperiodic gaits, including slope traversal and terrain adaptation. Compared to state-of-the-art whole-body controllers, the learned skills eliminate the need for online computation during execution and achieve control update rates exceeding 30x those of existing methods. These findings highlight the effectiveness of integrating ILC with torque memory as a highly data-efficient and practical solution for legged locomotion in unstructured and dynamic environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Feasible Locomotion of Nanobots for Cancer Detection and Treatment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12400v1)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deploying motile nanosized particles, also known as ``nanobots'', in the human body promises to improve selectivity in drug delivery and reduce side effects. We consider a swarm of nanobots locating a single cancerous region and treating it by releasing an onboard payload of drugs at the site. At nanoscale, the computation, communication, sensing, and locomotion capabilities of individual agents are extremely limited, noisy, and/or nonexistent. We present a general model to formally describe the individual and collective behavior of agents in a colloidal environment, such as the bloodstream, for cancer detection and treatment by nanobots. This includes a feasible and precise model of agent locomotion, inspired by actual nanoparticles that, in the presence of an external chemical gradient, move towards areas of higher concentration by means of self-propulsion. We present two variants of our general model: The first assumes an endogenous chemical gradient that is fixed over time and centered at the targeted cancer site; the second is a more speculative and dynamic variant in which agents themselves create and amplify a chemical gradient centered at the cancer site. In both settings, agents can sense the gradient and ascend it noisily, locating the cancer site more quickly than via simple Brownian motion. For the first variant of the model, we present simulation results to show the behavior of agents under our locomotion model, as well as {analytical results} to bound the time it takes for the agents to reach the cancer site. For the second variant, simulation results highlight the collective benefit in having agents issue their own chemical signal. While arguably more speculative in its agent capability assumptions, this variant shows a significant improvement in runtime performance over the first variant, resulting from its chemical signal amplification mechanism.</p></details> |  |

We demonstrate that this simplification significantly impairs sim-to-real transfer by failing to capture essential aspects such as joint coupling, friction dynamics, and motor-space control characteristics. In this work, we present an RL framework that explicitly incorporates closed-chain dynamics and validate it on our custom-built robot TopA. Our approach enhances policy robustness through symmetry-aware loss functions, adversarial training, and targeted network regularization. Experimental results demonstrate that our integrated approach achieves stable locomotion across diverse terrains, significantly outperforming methods based on simplified kinematic models.</p></details> |  |

We leverage deep reinforcement learning to train a single locomotion policy on procedurally generated robots. The policy maps proprioceptive robot state information and base velocity commands into desired joint actuation targets, which are conditioned using a latent embedding of the temporally local system dynamics. We explore two conditioning strategies - one using a GRU-based dynamics encoder and another using a morphology-based property estimator - and show that morphology-aware conditioning outperforms temporal dynamics encoding regarding velocity task tracking for our hardware test on ANYmal C. Our results demonstrate that both approaches achieve robust zero-shot transfer across multiple unseen simulated quadrupeds. Furthermore, we demonstrate the need for careful robot reference modelling during training: exposing the policy to a diverse set of robot morphologies and dynamics leads to improved generalization, reducing the velocity tracking error by up to 30% compared to the baseline method. Despite PAL not surpassing the best-performing reference-free controller in all cases, our analysis uncovers critical design choices and informs improvements to the state of the art.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 tables, 5 figures</p></details> |

Such a problem is non-trivial, posing three major challenges in quadruped locomotion control. First, how to model or represent the dynamics of the load in a generic manner. Second, how to make the robot capture the dynamics without any external sensing. Third, how to enable the robot to interact with load handling the mutual effect and stabilizing the load. In this work, we propose a general load modeling approach called load characteristics modeling to capture the dynamics of the load.

As a result, expectations are rising for the automation of tasks such as material transport and exploration in unknown environments. However, autonomous locomotion in rough terrains with significant height variations requires vertical movement, and robots capable of performing such movements stably, along with their control methods, have not yet been fully established. In this study, we developed the quadruped robot KLEIYN, which features a waist joint, and aimed to expand quadruped locomotion by enabling chimney climbing through RL. To facilitate the learning of vertical motion, we introduced Contact-Guided Curriculum Learning (CGCL). As a result, KLEIYN successfully climbed walls ranging from 800 mm to 1000 mm in width at an average speed of 150 mm/s, 50 times faster than conventional robots.

Those out-of-distribution situations for legged robot mainly include challenging dynamic gaps and perceptual gaps. Here we study the problem of robust locomotion in such novel situations. While previous methods usually rely on designing elaborate training and adaptation techniques, we approach the problem from a network model perspective. Our approach, RObust Locomotion Transformer(ROLT),a variation of transformer,could achieve robustness in a variety of unseen conditions. ROLT introduces two key designs: body tokenization and consistent dropout. Body tokenization supports knowledge share across different limbs, which boosts generalization ability of the network. Meanwhile, a novel dropout strategy enhances the policy's robustness to unseen perceptual noise. We conduct extensive experiments both on quadruped and hexapod robots. Results demonstrate that ROLT is more robust than existing methods. Although trained in only a few dynamic settings, the learned policy generalizes well to multiple unseen dynamic conditions. Additionally, despite training with clean observations, the model handles challenging corruption noise during testing.</p></details> |  |

While transferring into hand articulatied object interaction (HAOI), the hand grasps synthesis requires not only object functionality but also long-term manipulation sequence along the object deformation. This paper proposes a novel HAOI sequence generation framework SynHLMA, to synthesize hand language manipulation for articulated objects. Given a complete point cloud of an articulated object, we utilize a discrete HAOI representation to model each hand object interaction frame. Along with the natural language embeddings, the representations are trained by an HAOI manipulation language model to align the grasping process with its language description in a shared representation space. A joint-aware loss is employed to ensure hand grasps follow the dynamic variations of articulated object joints. In this way, our SynHLMA achieves three typical hand manipulation tasks for articulated objects of HAOI generation, HAOI prediction and HAOI interpolation. We evaluate SynHLMA on our built HAOI-lang dataset and experimental results demonstrate the superior hand grasp sequence generation performance comparing with state-of-the-art. We also show a robotics grasp application that enables dexterous grasps execution from imitation learning using the manipulation sequence provided by our SynHLMA. Our codes and datasets will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |

We advance the notion of failure-resilient policies, which not only detect failures but also recover from them automatically. Failure recognition that identifies the factors causing failure is key to informing recovery: e.g. pinpointing image regions triggering failure detections can provide cues to guide recovery. We present Fare, a framework to construct failure-resilient IL policies, embedding OOD-detection and recognition in them without using explicit failure data, and pairing them with recovery heuristics. Real-world experiments show that Fare enables failure recovery across two different policy architectures, enabling robust long-range navigation in complex environments.</p></details> |  |

Research evolved from handcrafted feature extraction to large-scale automated feature learning. With foundation models (FMs), crop disease datasets are now processed in fundamentally new ways. Unlike traditional neural networks, FMs integrate visual and textual data, interpret symptoms in text, reason about symptom-management relationships, and support interactive QA for growers and educators. Adaptive and imitation learning in robotics further enables field-based disease management. This review screened approx. 40 articles on FM applications for SSDM, focusing on large-language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), and discussing their role in adaptive learning (AL), reinforcement learning (RL), and digital twin frameworks for targeted spraying. Key findings: (a) FMs are gaining traction with surging literature in 2023-24; (b) VLMs outpace LLMs, with a 5-10x increase in publications; (c) RL and AL are still nascent for smart spraying; (d) digital twins with RL can simulate targeted spraying virtually; (e) addressing the sim-to-real gap is critical for real-world deployment; (f) human-robot collaboration remains limited, especially in human-in-the-loop approaches where robots detect early symptoms and humans validate uncertain cases; (g) multi-modal FMs with real-time feedback will drive next-gen SSDM.

Existing frameworks largely rely on Imitation Learning (IL), which can be limited by sub-optimal expert demonstrations and covariate shift during deployment. On the other hand, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has recently shown potential in scaling up with simulations, but is typically confined to low-dimensional symbolic inputs (e.g. 3D objects and maps), falling short of full end-to-end learning from raw sensor data. We introduce ZTRS (Zero-Imitation End-to-End Autonomous Driving with Trajectory Scoring), a framework that combines the strengths of both worlds: sensor inputs without losing information and RL training for robust planning. To the best of our knowledge, ZTRS is the first framework that eliminates IL entirely by only learning from rewards while operating directly on high-dimensional sensor data. ZTRS utilizes offline reinforcement learning with our proposed Exhaustive Policy Optimization (EPO), a variant of policy gradient tailored for enumerable actions and rewards. ZTRS demonstrates strong performance across three benchmarks: Navtest (generic real-world open-loop planning), Navhard (open-loop planning in challenging real-world and synthetic scenarios), and HUGSIM (simulated closed-loop driving).

We propose a framework combining a Language-Conditioned Visual Representation (LCVR) module and a Language-conditioned Mixture-ofExperts Density Policy (LMoE-DP). LCVR resolves perceptual ambiguities by grounding visual features with language instructions, enabling differentiation between visually similar tasks. To mitigate task conflict, LMoE-DP uses a sparse expert architecture to specialize in distinct, multimodal action distributions, stabilized by gradient modulation. On real-robot benchmarks, LCVR boosts Action Chunking with Transformers (ACT) and Diffusion Policy (DP) success rates by 33.75% and 25%, respectively. The full framework achieves a 79% average success, outperforming the advanced baseline by 21%. Our work shows that combining semantic grounding and expert specialization enables robust, efficient multi-task manipulation</p></details> | 8 pages |

Classical mobility stacks, though effective on specific platforms, require extensive per-robot tuning and do not scale easily to new embodiments. Learning-based approaches, such as imitation learning (IL), offer alternatives, but face significant limitations on the need for high-quality demonstrations for each embodiment. To address these challenges, we introduce COMPASS, a unified framework that enables scalable cross-embodiment mobility using expert demonstrations from only a single embodiment. We first pre-train a mobility policy on a single robot using IL, combining a world model with a policy model. We then apply residual reinforcement learning (RL) to efficiently adapt this policy to diverse embodiments through corrective refinements. Finally, we distill specialist policies into a single generalist policy conditioned on an embodiment embedding vector. This design significantly reduces the burden of collecting data while enabling robust generalization across a wide range of robot designs. Our experiments demonstrate that COMPASS scales effectively across diverse robot platforms while maintaining adaptability to various environment configurations, achieving a generalist policy with a success rate approximately 5X higher than the pre-trained IL policy on unseen embodiments, and further demonstrates zero-shot sim-to-real transfer.</p></details> |  |

We propose Structured Reinforcement Learning (SRL), a novel actor-critic paradigm that embeds combinatorial optimization-layers into the actor neural network. We enable end-to-end learning of the actor via Fenchel-Young losses and provide a geometric interpretation of SRL as a primal-dual algorithm in the dual of the moment polytope.

Although reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training has proven effective in addressing data scarcity, its application to VLA models is hindered by the non-resettable nature of real-world environments. This limitation is particularly critical in high-risk domains such as industrial automation, where interactions often induce state changes that are costly or infeasible to revert. Furthermore, existing VLA approaches lack a reliable mechanism for detecting task completion, leading to redundant actions that reduce overall task success rates. To address these challenges, we propose World-Env, an RL-based post-training framework that replaces physical interaction with a low-cost, world model-based virtual simulator. World-Env consists of two key components: (1) a video-based world simulator that generates temporally consistent future visual observations, and (2) a vision-language model (VLM)-guided instant reflector that provides continuous reward signals and predicts action termination. This simulated environment enables VLA models to safely explore and generalize beyond their initial imitation learning distribution. Our method achieves notable performance gains with as few as five expert demonstrations per task. Experiments on complex robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that World-Env effectively overcomes the data inefficiency, safety constraints, and inefficient execution of conventional VLA models that rely on real-world interaction, offering a practical and scalable solution for post-training in resource-constrained settings.

| **[On the Importance of Tactile Sensing for Imitation Learning: A Case Study on Robotic Match Lighting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13618v3)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The field of robotic manipulation has advanced significantly in recent years. At the sensing level, several novel tactile sensors have been developed, capable of providing accurate contact information. On a methodological level, learning from demonstrations has proven an efficient paradigm to obtain performant robotic manipulation policies. The combination of both holds the promise to extract crucial contact-related information from the demonstration data and actively exploit it during policy rollouts. However, this integration has so far been underexplored, most notably in dynamic, contact-rich manipulation tasks where precision and reactivity are essential. This work therefore proposes a multimodal, visuotactile imitation learning framework that integrates a modular transformer architecture with a flow-based generative model, enabling efficient learning of fast and dexterous manipulation policies. We evaluate our framework on the dynamic, contact-rich task of robotic match lighting - a task in which tactile feedback influences human manipulation performance. The experimental results highlight the effectiveness of our approach and show that adding tactile information improves policy performance, thereby underlining their combined potential for learning dynamic manipulation from few demonstrations.

Recently, 3D scene analogies have been proposed to connect two 3D scenes, which are smooth maps that align scene regions with common spatial relationships. These maps enable detailed transfer of trajectories or waypoints, potentially supporting demonstration transfer for imitation learning or task plan transfer across scenes. However, existing methods for the task require additional training and fixed object vocabularies. In this work, we propose to use multimodal foundation models for finding 3D scene analogies in a zero-shot, open-vocabulary setting. Central to our approach is a hybrid neural representation of scenes that consists of a sparse graph based on vision-language model features and a feature field derived from 3D shape foundation models. 3D scene analogies are then found in a coarse-to-fine manner, by first aligning the graph and refining the correspondence with feature fields. Our method can establish accurate correspondences between complex scenes, and we showcase applications in trajectory and waypoint transfer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to FM4RoboPlan workshop at RSS 2025</p></details> |

However, existing methods ignore the learning of posture-dependent task features, which are crucial for adapting dual-arm configurations to meet specific force and velocity requirements in dexterous bimanual manipulation. To address this limitation, we propose Manipulability-Aware Diffusion Policy (ManiDP), a novel imitation learning method that not only generates plausible bimanual trajectories, but also optimizes dual-arm configurations to better satisfy posture-dependent task requirements. ManiDP achieves this by extracting bimanual manipulability from expert demonstrations and encoding the encapsulated posture features using Riemannian-based probabilistic models. These encoded posture features are then incorporated into a conditional diffusion process to guide the generation of task-compatible bimanual motion sequences. We evaluate ManiDP on six real-world bimanual tasks, where the experimental results demonstrate a 39.33$\%$ increase in average manipulation success rate and a 0.45 improvement in task compatibility compared to baseline methods. This work highlights the importance of integrating posture-relevant robotic priors into bimanual skill diffusion to enable human-like adaptability and dexterity.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures, Accepted and published in IROS 2025</p></details> |
| **[CIVIL: Causal and Intuitive Visual Imitation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17959v3)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Today's robots attempt to learn new tasks by imitating human examples. These robots watch the human complete the task, and then try to match the actions taken by the human expert. However, this standard approach to visual imitation learning is fundamentally limited: the robot observes what the human does, but not why the human chooses those behaviors. Without understanding which features of the system or environment factor into the human's decisions, robot learners often misinterpret the human's examples. In practice, this results in causal confusion, inefficient learning, and robot policies that fail when the environment changes. We therefore propose a shift in perspective: instead of asking human teachers just to show what actions the robot should take, we also enable humans to intuitively indicate why they made those decisions. Under our paradigm human teachers attach markers to task-relevant objects and use natural language prompts to describe their state representation. Our proposed algorithm, CIVIL, leverages this augmented demonstration data to filter the robot's visual observations and extract a feature representation that aligns with the human teacher. CIVIL then applies these causal features to train a transformer-based policy that -- when tested on the robot -- is able to emulate human behaviors without being confused by visual distractors or irrelevant items. Our simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate that robots trained with CIVIL learn both what actions to take and why to take those actions, resulting in better performance than state-of-the-art baselines. From the human's perspective, our user study reveals that this new training paradigm actually reduces the total time required for the robot to learn the task, and also improves the robot's performance in previously unseen scenarios.

To address this issue, we present edge collaborative GS (ECO-GS), where each user can switch between a local small GS model to guarantee timeliness and a remote large GS model to guarantee fidelity. However, deciding how to engage the large GS model is nontrivial, due to the interdependency between rendering requirements and resource conditions. To this end, we propose integrated rendering and communication (IRAC), which jointly optimizes collaboration status (i.e., deciding whether to engage large GS) and edge power allocation (i.e., enabling remote rendering) under communication constraints across different users by minimizing a newly-derived GS switching function. Despite the nonconvexity of the problem, we propose an efficient penalty majorization minimization (PMM) algorithm to obtain the critical point solution. Furthermore, we develop an imitation learning optimization (ILO) algorithm, which reduces the computational time by over 100x compared to PMM. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of PMM and the real-time execution capability of ILO.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages and 7 figures, submitted for possible publication</p></details> |

In this work, we introduce an imitation-learning-based Self-Speculative Decoding (SSD) framework, named FastVLM, to address these limitations. Our approach employs a lightweight draft model for token generation in an autoregressive manner, while a full model verifies these tokens non-autoregressively. Accepted tokens proceed seamlessly, while rejected tokens are corrected by the full model and used to guide the draft model's refinement. Through an imitation network, FastVLM enhances the draft model by integrating deeper level insights from the full model's architecture. Also, it maintains the performance integrity of the full model while training the draft model, achieving a balance between efficiency and accuracy. Our method speeds up the inference process by 1.55-1.85x as compared to the final layer with minimal loss in performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at the main Conference IJCNLP-AACL 2025</p></details> |

The core idea is to use MCTS to find a promising set of safe candidate trajectories and a deep IRL scoring function to select the most human-like among them. We evaluate TreeIRL against both classical and state-of-the-art planners in large-scale simulations and on 500+ miles of real-world autonomous driving in the Las Vegas metropolitan area. Test scenarios include dense urban traffic, adaptive cruise control, cut-ins, and traffic lights. TreeIRL achieves the best overall performance, striking a balance between safety, progress, comfort, and human-likeness. To our knowledge, our work is the first demonstration of MCTS-based planning on public roads and underscores the importance of evaluating planners across a diverse set of metrics and in real-world environments. TreeIRL is highly extensible and could be further improved with reinforcement learning and imitation learning, providing a framework for exploring different combinations of classical and learning-based approaches to solve the planning bottleneck in autonomous driving.</p></details> |  |

Yet, when trained via imitation learning, their high generative capacity makes them sensitive to noise in human demonstrations: jerks, pauses, and jitter which reduce action coherence. Reduced action coherence causes instability and trajectory drift during deployment, failures that are catastrophic in fine-grained manipulation where precision is crucial. In this paper, we present Action Coherence Guidance (ACG) for VLA models, a training-free test-time guidance algorithm that improves action coherence and thereby yields performance gains. Evaluated on RoboCasa, DexMimicGen, and real-world SO-101 tasks, ACG consistently improves action coherence and boosts success rates across diverse manipulation tasks.

| **[CCDP: Composition of Conditional Diffusion Policies with Guided Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15386v3)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation Learning offers a promising approach to learn directly from data without requiring explicit models, simulations, or detailed task definitions. During inference, actions are sampled from the learned distribution and executed on the robot. However, sampled actions may fail for various reasons, and simply repeating the sampling step until a successful action is obtained can be inefficient. In this work, we propose an enhanced sampling strategy that refines the sampling distribution to avoid previously unsuccessful actions. We demonstrate that by solely utilizing data from successful demonstrations, our method can infer recovery actions without the need for additional exploratory behavior or a high-level controller. Furthermore, we leverage the concept of diffusion model decomposition to break down the primary problem, which may require long-horizon history to manage failures, into multiple smaller, more manageable sub-problems in learning, data collection, and inference, thereby enabling the system to adapt to variable failure counts. Our approach yields a low-level controller that dynamically adjusts its sampling space to improve efficiency when prior samples fall short. We validate our method across several tasks, including door opening with unknown directions, object manipulation, and button-searching scenarios, demonstrating that our approach outperforms traditional baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IROS 2025</p></details> |

However, applying RL to end-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD) remains an open problem for its training difficulty, and IL is still the mainstream paradigm in both academia and industry. Recently Model-based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) have demonstrated promising results in neural planning; however, these methods typically require privileged information as input rather than raw sensor data. We fill this gap by designing Raw2Drive, a dual-stream MBRL approach. Initially, we efficiently train an auxiliary privileged world model paired with a neural planner that uses privileged information as input. Subsequently, we introduce a raw sensor world model trained via our proposed Guidance Mechanism, which ensures consistency between the raw sensor world model and the privileged world model during rollouts. Finally, the raw sensor world model combines the prior knowledge embedded in the heads of the privileged world model to effectively guide the training of the raw sensor policy. Raw2Drive is so far the only RL based end-to-end method on CARLA Leaderboard 2.0, and Bench2Drive and it achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Using Non-Expert Data to Robustify Imitation Learning via Offline Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19495v2)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation learning has proven effective for training robots to perform complex tasks from expert human demonstrations. However, it remains limited by its reliance on high-quality, task-specific data, restricting adaptability to the diverse range of real-world object configurations and scenarios. In contrast, non-expert data -- such as play data, suboptimal demonstrations, partial task completions, or rollouts from suboptimal policies -- can offer broader coverage and lower collection costs. However, conventional imitation learning approaches fail to utilize this data effectively. To address these challenges, we posit that with right design decisions, offline reinforcement learning can be used as a tool to harness non-expert data to enhance the performance of imitation learning policies. We show that while standard offline RL approaches can be ineffective at actually leveraging non-expert data under the sparse data coverage settings typically encountered in the real world, simple algorithmic modifications can allow for the utilization of this data, without significant additional assumptions. Our approach shows that broadening the support of the policy distribution can allow imitation algorithms augmented by offline RL to solve tasks robustly, showing considerably enhanced recovery and generalization behavior. In manipulation tasks, these innovations significantly increase the range of initial conditions where learned policies are successful when non-expert data is incorporated. Moreover, we show that these methods are able to leverage all collected data, including partial or suboptimal demonstrations, to bolster task-directed policy performance. This underscores the importance of algorithmic techniques for using non-expert data for robust policy learning in robotics. Website: https://uwrobotlearning.github.io/RISE-offline/</p></details> |  |

Our recipe is designed for the offline-to-online RL setting, where the goal is to leverage an offline prior dataset to maximize the sample-efficiency of online learning. Effective exploration and sample-efficient learning remain central challenges in this setting, as it is not obvious how the offline data should be utilized to acquire a good exploratory policy. Our key insight is that action chunking, a technique popularized in imitation learning where sequences of future actions are predicted rather than a single action at each timestep, can be applied to temporal difference (TD)-based RL methods to mitigate the exploration challenge. Q-chunking adopts action chunking by directly running RL in a 'chunked' action space, enabling the agent to (1) leverage temporally consistent behaviors from offline data for more effective online exploration and (2) use unbiased $n$-step backups for more stable and efficient TD learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that Q-chunking exhibits strong offline performance and online sample efficiency, outperforming prior best offline-to-online methods on a range of long-horizon, sparse-reward manipulation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>The T...</summary><p>The Thirty-Ninth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025); 36 pages, 17 figures</p></details> |

However, existing imitation learning datasets contain only successful trajectories and lack failure or recovery data, especially for out-of-distribution (OOD) states where the robot deviates from the main policy due to minor perturbations or errors, leading VLA models to struggle with states deviating from the training distribution. To this end, we propose an automated OOD data augmentation framework named RESample through exploratory sampling. Specifically, we first leverage offline reinforcement learning to obtain an action-value network that accurately identifies sub-optimal actions under the current manipulation policy. We further sample potential OOD states from trajectories via rollout, and design an exploratory sampling mechanism that adaptively incorporates these action proxies into the training dataset to ensure efficiency. Subsequently, our framework explicitly encourages the VLAs to recover from OOD states and enhances their robustness against distributional shifts. We conduct extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark as well as real-world robotic manipulation tasks, demonstrating that RESample consistently improves the stability and generalization ability of VLA models.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages,7 figures, submitted to ICRA2026</p></details> |

In contrast to existing action tokenizers based on vector quantization or byte pair encoding, BEAST requires no separate tokenizer training and consistently produces tokens of uniform length, enabling fast action sequence generation via parallel decoding. Leveraging our B-spline formulation, BEAST inherently ensures generating smooth trajectories without discontinuities between adjacent segments. We extensively evaluate BEAST by integrating it with three distinct model architectures: a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with continuous tokens, a decoder-only Transformer with discrete tokens, and Florence-2, a pretrained Vision-Language Model with an encoder-decoder architecture, demonstrating BEAST's compatibility and scalability with large pretrained models. We evaluate BEAST across three established benchmarks consisting of 166 simulated tasks and on three distinct robot settings with a total of 8 real-world tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that BEAST (i) significantly reduces both training and inference computational costs, and (ii) consistently generates smooth, high-frequency control signals suitable for continuous control tasks while (iii) reliably achieves competitive task success rates compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

A promising solution is interactive imitation learning from human intervention, where a human expert observes the policy's execution and provides interventions as feedback. However, existing methods often fail to utilize the prior policy efficiently to facilitate learning, thus hindering sample efficiency. In this work, we introduce MEReQ (Maximum-Entropy Residual-Q Inverse Reinforcement Learning), designed for sample-efficient alignment from human intervention. Instead of inferring the complete human behavior characteristics, MEReQ infers a residual reward function that captures the discrepancy between the human expert's and the prior policy's underlying reward functions. It then employs Residual Q-Learning (RQL) to align the policy with human preferences using this residual reward function. Extensive evaluations on simulated and real-world tasks demonstrate that MEReQ achieves sample-efficient policy alignment from human intervention.</p></details> |  |

This means that when a BC agent makes a mistake which takes them out of the support of the demonstrations, they often don't know how to recover from it. In this sense, BC is akin to giving the agent the fish -- giving them dense supervision across a narrow set of states -- rather than teaching them to fish: to be able to reason independently about achieving the expert's outcome even when faced with unseen situations at test-time. In response, we explore learning to search (L2S) from expert demonstrations, i.e. learning the components required to, at test time, plan to match expert outcomes, even after making a mistake. These include (1) a world model and (2) a reward model. We carefully ablate the set of algorithmic and design decisions required to combine these and other components for stable and sample/interaction-efficient learning of recovery behavior without additional human corrections. Across a dozen visual manipulation tasks from three benchmarks, our approach SAILOR consistently out-performs state-of-the-art Diffusion Policies trained via BC on the same data. Furthermore, scaling up the amount of demonstrations used for BC by 5-10x still leaves a performance gap. We find that SAILOR can identify nuanced failures and is robust to reward hacking.

Despite recent fundamental advances in the theoretical analysis of policy gradient (PG) methods for standard RL and recent efforts in RLGU, the understanding of these PG algorithms and their scope of application in RLGU still remain limited. In this work, we establish global optimality guarantees of PG methods for RLGU in which the objective is a general concave utility function of the state-action occupancy measure. In the tabular setting, we provide global optimality results using a new proof technique building on recent theoretical developments on the convergence of PG methods for standard RL using gradient domination. Our proof technique opens avenues for analyzing policy parameterizations beyond the direct policy parameterization for RLGU. In addition, we provide global optimality results for large state-action space settings beyond prior work which has mostly focused on the tabular setting. In this large scale setting, we adapt PG methods by approximating occupancy measures within a function approximation class using maximum likelihood estimation. Our sample complexity only scales with the dimension induced by our approximation class instead of the size of the state-action space.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 camera ready</p></details> |

Despite numerous efforts toward end-to-end autonomy, a fully autonomous suturing pipeline has yet to be demonstrated on physical hardware. We introduce SutureBot: an autonomous suturing benchmark on the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK), spanning needle pickup, tissue insertion, and knot tying. To ensure repeatability, we release a high-fidelity dataset comprising 1,890 suturing demonstrations.

Point clouds capture detailed geometric structure, while RGB images provide rich semantic context. Current point cloud methods struggle to capture fine-grained detail, especially for complex tasks, which RGB methods lack geometric awareness, which hinders their precision and generalization. We introduce PointMapPolicy, a novel approach that conditions diffusion policies on structured grids of points without downsampling. The resulting data type makes it easier to extract shape and spatial relationships from observations, and can be transformed between reference frames. Yet due to their structure in a regular grid, we enable the use of established computer vision techniques directly to 3D data. Using xLSTM as a backbone, our model efficiently fuses the point maps with RGB data for enhanced multi-modal perception.

| **[VO-DP: Semantic-Geometric Adaptive Diffusion Policy for Vision-Only Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15530v3)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of imitation learning, visuomotor-based diffusion policy learning is one of the main directions in robotic manipulation. Most of these approaches rely on point clouds as observation inputs and construct scene representations through point clouds feature learning, which enables them to achieve remarkable accuracy. However, the existing literature lacks an in-depth exploration of vision-only solutions that have significant potential. In this paper, we propose a Vision-Only and single-view Diffusion Policy learning method (VO-DP) that leverages pretrained visual foundation models to achieve effective fusion of semantic and geometric features. We utilize intermediate features from VGGT incorporating semantic features from DINOv2 and geometric features from Alternating Attention blocks. Features are fused via cross-attention and spatially compressed with a CNN to form the input to the policy head. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VO-DP not only outperforms the vision-only baseline DP significantly but also exhibits distinct performance trends against the point cloud-based method DP3: in simulation tasks, VO-DP achieves an average success rate of 64.6% on par with DP3 64.0% and far higher than DP 34.8%, while in real-world tasks, it reaches 87.9%, outperforming both DP3 67.5% and DP 11.2% by a notable margin. Further robustness evaluations confirm that VO-DP remains highly stable under varying conditions including color, size, background, and lighting. Lastly, we open-source a training library for robotic manipulation. Built on Accelerate, this library supports multi-machine and multi-GPU parallel training, as well as mixed precision training. It is compatible with visuomotor policies such as DP, DP3 and VO-DP, and also supports the RoboTwin simulator.</p></details> |  |
| **[CE-Nav: Flow-Guided Reinforcement Refinement for Cross-Embodiment Local Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23203v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalizing local navigation policies across diverse robot morphologies is a critical challenge. Progress is often hindered by the need for costly and embodiment-specific data, the tight coupling of planning and control, and the "disastrous averaging" problem where deterministic models fail to capture multi-modal decisions (e.g., turning left or right). We introduce CE-Nav, a novel two-stage (IL-then-RL) framework that systematically decouples universal geometric reasoning from embodiment-specific dynamic adaptation. First, we train an embodiment-agnostic General Expert offline using imitation learning. This expert, a conditional normalizing flow model named VelFlow, learns the full distribution of kinematically-sound actions from a large-scale dataset generated by a classical planner, completely avoiding real robot data and resolving the multi-modality issue. Second, for a new robot, we freeze the expert and use it as a guiding prior to train a lightweight, Dynamics-Aware Refiner via online reinforcement learning. This refiner rapidly learns to compensate for the target robot's specific dynamics and controller imperfections with minimal environmental interaction. Extensive experiments on quadrupeds, bipeds, and quadrotors show that CE-Nav achieves state-of-the-art performance while drastically reducing adaptation cost. Successful real-world deployments further validate our approach as an efficient and scalable solution for building generalizable navigation systems.

This paper proposes an imitation learning-based framework to approximate mixed-integer Economic Model Predictive Control (EMPC) for microgrid energy management. The proposed method trains a neural network to imitate expert EMPC control actions from offline trajectories, enabling fast, real-time decision making without solving optimization problems online. To enhance robustness and generalization, the learning process includes noise injection during training to mitigate distribution shift and explicitly incorporates forecast uncertainty in renewable generation and demand. Simulation results demonstrate that the learned policy achieves economic performance comparable to EMPC while only requiring $10\%$ of the computation time of optimization-based EMPC in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence (EAAI) and IFAC WC 2026</p></details> |
| **[Action Tokenizer Matters in In-Context Imitation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01206v3)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-context imitation learning (ICIL) is a new paradigm that enables robots to generalize from demonstrations to unseen tasks without retraining. A well-structured action representation is the key to capturing demonstration information effectively, yet action tokenizer (the process of discretizing and encoding actions) remains largely unexplored in ICIL. In this work, we first systematically evaluate existing action tokenizer methods in ICIL and reveal a critical limitation: while they effectively encode action trajectories, they fail to preserve temporal smoothness, which is crucial for stable robotic execution. To address this, we propose LipVQ-VAE, a variational autoencoder that enforces the Lipschitz condition in the latent action space via weight normalization. By propagating smoothness constraints from raw action inputs to a quantized latent codebook, LipVQ-VAE generates more stable and smoother actions. When integrating into ICIL, LipVQ-VAE improves performance by more than 5.3% in high-fidelity simulators, with real-world experiments confirming its ability to produce smoother, more reliable trajectories.

| **[Imitation Learning Policy based on Multi-Step Consistent Integration Shortcut Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19356v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The wide application of flow-matching methods has greatly promoted the development of robot imitation learning. However, these methods all face the problem of high inference time. To address this issue, researchers have proposed distillation methods and consistency methods, but the performance of these methods still struggles to compete with that of the original diffusion models and flow-matching models. In this article, we propose a one-step shortcut method with multi-step integration for robot imitation learning. To balance the inference speed and performance, we extend the multi-step consistency loss on the basis of the shortcut model, split the one-step loss into multi-step losses, and improve the performance of one-step inference. Secondly, to solve the problem of unstable optimization of the multi-step loss and the original flow-matching loss, we propose an adaptive gradient allocation method to enhance the stability of the learning process. Finally, we evaluate the proposed method in two simulation benchmarks and five real-world environment tasks. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified Reinforcement and Imitation Learning for Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19307v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their large scale often renders them impractical for resource-constrained environments. This paper introduces Unified Reinforcement and Imitation Learning (RIL), a novel and efficient training algorithm designed to create powerful, lightweight VLMs. RIL distinctively combines the strengths of reinforcement learning with adversarial imitation learning. This enables smaller student VLMs not only to mimic the sophisticated text generation of large teacher models but also to systematically improve their generative capabilities through reinforcement signals. Key to our imitation framework is an LLM-based discriminator that adeptly distinguishes between student and teacher outputs, complemented by guidance from multiple large teacher VLMs to ensure diverse learning. This unified learning strategy, leveraging both reinforcement and imitation, empowers student models to achieve significant performance gains, making them competitive with leading closed-source VLMs. Extensive experiments on diverse vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that RIL significantly narrows the performance gap with state-of-the-art open- and closed-source VLMs and, in several instances, surpasses them.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025, Project page: https://byungkwanlee.github.io/RIL-page</p></details> |
| **[ComDrive: Comfort-Oriented End-to-End Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05051v2)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose ComDrive: the first comfort-oriented end-to-end autonomous driving system to generate temporally consistent and comfortable trajectories. Recent studies have demonstrated that imitation learning-based planners and learning-based trajectory scorers can effectively generate and select safety trajectories that closely mimic expert demonstrations. However, such trajectory planners and scorers face the challenge of generating temporally inconsistent and uncomfortable trajectories. To address these issues, ComDrive first extracts 3D spatial representations through sparse perception, which then serves as conditional inputs. These inputs are used by a Conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM)-based motion planner to generate temporally consistent multi-modal trajectories. A dual-stream adaptive trajectory scorer subsequently selects the most comfortable trajectory from these candidates to control the vehicle. Experiments demonstrate that ComDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance in both comfort and safety, outperforming UniAD by 17% in driving comfort and reducing collision rates by 25% compared to SparseDrive.

| **[Flow with the Force Field: Learning 3D Compliant Flow Matching Policies from Force and Demonstration-Guided Simulation Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02738v2)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While visuomotor policy has made advancements in recent years, contact-rich tasks still remain a challenge. Robotic manipulation tasks that require continuous contact demand explicit handling of compliance and force. However, most visuomotor policies ignore compliance, overlooking the importance of physical interaction with the real world, often leading to excessive contact forces or fragile behavior under uncertainty. Introducing force information into vision-based imitation learning could help improve awareness of contacts, but could also require a lot of data to perform well. One remedy for data scarcity is to generate data in simulation, yet computationally taxing processes are required to generate data good enough not to suffer from the Sim2Real gap. In this work, we introduce a framework for generating force-informed data in simulation, instantiated by a single human demonstration, and show how coupling with a compliant policy improves the performance of a visuomotor policy learned from synthetic data. We validate our approach on real-robot tasks, including non-prehensile block flipping and a bi-manual object moving, where the learned policy exhibits reliable contact maintenance and adaptation to novel conditions.

| **[Inverse Q-Learning Done Right: Offline Imitation Learning in $Q^π$-Realizable MDPs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19946v3)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of offline imitation learning in Markov decision processes (MDPs), where the goal is to learn a well-performing policy given a dataset of state-action pairs generated by an expert policy. Complementing a recent line of work on this topic that assumes the expert belongs to a tractable class of known policies, we approach this problem from a new angle and leverage a different type of structural assumption about the environment. Specifically, for the class of linear $Q^\pi$-realizable MDPs, we introduce a new algorithm called saddle-point offline imitation learning (\SPOIL), which is guaranteed to match the performance of any expert up to an additive error $\varepsilon$ with access to $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-2})$ samples. Moreover, we extend this result to possibly non-linear $Q^\pi$-realizable MDPs at the cost of a worse sample complexity of order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-4})$. Finally, our analysis suggests a new loss function for training critic networks from expert data in deep imitation learning. Empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that the neural net implementation of \SPOIL is superior to behavior cloning and competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[MoMaGen: Generating Demonstrations under Soft and Hard Constraints for Multi-Step Bimanual Mobile Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18316v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation learning from large-scale, diverse human demonstrations has proven effective for training robots, but collecting such data is costly and time-consuming. This challenge is amplified for multi-step bimanual mobile manipulation, where humans must teleoperate both a mobile base and two high-degree-of-freedom arms. Prior automated data generation frameworks have addressed static bimanual manipulation by augmenting a few human demonstrations in simulation, but they fall short for mobile settings due to two key challenges: (1) determining base placement to ensure reachability, and (2) positioning the camera to provide sufficient visibility for visuomotor policies. To address these issues, we introduce MoMaGen, which formulates data generation as a constrained optimization problem that enforces hard constraints (e.g., reachability) while balancing soft constraints (e.g., visibility during navigation). This formulation generalizes prior approaches and provides a principled foundation for future methods. We evaluate MoMaGen on four multi-step bimanual mobile manipulation tasks and show that it generates significantly more diverse datasets than existing methods. Leveraging this diversity, MoMaGen can train successful imitation learning policies from a single source demonstration, and these policies can be fine-tuned with as few as 40 real-world demonstrations to achieve deployment on physical robotic hardware.

In this work, we propose RAD, a 3DGS-based closed-loop Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework for end-to-end Autonomous Driving. By leveraging 3DGS techniques, we construct a photorealistic digital replica of the real physical world, enabling the AD policy to extensively explore the state space and learn to handle out-of-distribution scenarios through large-scale trial and error. To enhance safety, we design specialized rewards to guide the policy in effectively responding to safety-critical events and understanding real-world causal relationships. To better align with human driving behavior, we incorporate IL into RL training as a regularization term. We introduce a closed-loop evaluation benchmark consisting of diverse, previously unseen 3DGS environments. Compared to IL-based methods, RAD achieves stronger performance in most closed-loop metrics, particularly exhibiting a 3x lower collision rate. Abundant closed-loop results are presented in the supplementary material.

While IL has been widely applied to single-robot settings, relatively few studies have addressed the extension of these methods to multi-agent systems, especially in settings where a single human must provide demonstrations to a team of collaborating robots. In this paper, we introduce and study Round-Robin Behavior Cloning (R2BC), a method that enables a single human operator to effectively train multi-robot systems through sequential, single-agent demonstrations. Our approach allows the human to teleoperate one agent at a time and incrementally teach multi-agent behavior to the entire system, without requiring demonstrations in the joint multi-agent action space. We show that R2BC methods match, and in some cases surpass, the performance of an oracle behavior cloning approach trained on privileged synchronized demonstrations across four multi-agent simulated tasks. Finally, we deploy R2BC on two physical robot tasks trained using real human demonstrations.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

Achieving this requires sim agent policies that are human-like, fast, and scalable in multi-agent settings. Recent progress in imitation learning with large diffusion-based or tokenized models has shown that behaviors can be captured directly from human driving data, producing realistic policies. However, these models are computationally expensive, slow during inference, and struggle to adapt in reactive, closed-loop scenarios. In contrast, self-play reinforcement learning (RL) scales efficiently and naturally captures multi-agent interactions, but it often relies on heuristics and reward shaping, and the resulting policies can diverge from human norms. We propose SPACeR, a framework that leverages a pretrained tokenized autoregressive motion model as a centralized reference policy to guide decentralized self-play. The reference model provides likelihood rewards and KL divergence, anchoring policies to the human driving distribution while preserving RL scalability. Evaluated on the Waymo Sim Agents Challenge, our method achieves competitive performance with imitation-learned policies while being up to 10x faster at inference and 50x smaller in parameter size than large generative models. In addition, we demonstrate in closed-loop ego planning evaluation tasks that our sim agents can effectively measure planner quality with fast and scalable traffic simulation, establishing a new paradigm for testing autonomous driving policies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://spacer-ai.github.io/</p></details> |

To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a novel framework for developing a versatile, zero-shot control policy from a large-scale offline dataset of historical PID-controlled discharges. Our approach synergistically combines Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) with Hilbert space representation learning to achieve dual objectives: mimicking the stable operational style of the PID data and constructing a geometrically structured latent space for efficient, goal-directed control. The resulting foundation policy can be deployed for diverse trajectory tracking tasks in a zero-shot manner without any task-specific fine-tuning. Evaluations on the HL-3 tokamak simulator demonstrate that the policy excels at precisely and stably tracking reference trajectories for key shape parameters across a range of plasma scenarios. This work presents a viable pathway toward developing highly flexible and data-efficient intelligent control systems for future fusion reactors.</p></details> |  |

While teleoperated robotic surgery provides natural expert demonstrations for imitation learning (IL), reinforcement learning (RL) could potentially discover superior strategies through self-exploration. We present the first comprehensive comparison of IL versus RL for surgical action planning on CholecT50. Our Dual-task Autoregressive Imitation Learning (DARIL) baseline achieves 34.6% action triplet recognition mAP and 33.6% next frame prediction mAP with smooth planning degradation to 29.2% at 10-second horizons. We evaluated three RL variants: world model-based RL, direct video RL, and inverse RL enhancement. Surprisingly, all RL approaches underperformed DARIL--world model RL dropped to 3.1% mAP at 10s while direct video RL achieved only 15.9%. Our analysis reveals that distribution matching on expert-annotated test sets systematically favors IL over potentially valid RL policies that differ from training demonstrations. This challenges assumptions about RL superiority in sequential decision making and provides crucial insights for surgical AI development.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted at the MICCAI2025 workshop proceedings on COLlaborative Intelligence and Autonomy in Image-guided Surgery (COLAS)</p></details> |

In this work, we propose a novel machine learning based method for decentralized kinodynamic planning that operates effectively under partial observability and without inter-agent communication. Our method leverages imitation learning to train a decentralized student policy for each UAV by imitating a centralized kinodynamic motion planner with access to privileged global observations. The student policy generates smooth trajectories using physics-informed neural networks that respect the derivative relationships in motion. During training, the student policies utilize the full trajectory generated by the teacher policy, leading to improved sample efficiency. Moreover, each student policy can be trained in under two hours on a standard laptop. We validate our method in both simulation and real-world environments to follow an agile reference trajectory, demonstrating performance comparable to that of centralized approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE MRS 2025</p></details> |

Focusing on honeybees, our approach leverages trajectory similarity to capture and forecast behavior across individuals that rely on distinct strategies: some exploiting numerical cues, others drawing on memory, or being influenced by environmental factors such as weather. Through empirical evaluation, we show that state-of-the-art imitation learning methods often fail in this setting: when expert policies shift across memory windows or deviate from optimality, these models overlook both fast and slow learning behaviors and cannot faithfully reproduce key decision patterns. Moreover, they offer limited interpretability, hindering biological insight. Our contribution addresses these challenges by (i) introducing a model that minimizes predictive loss while identifying the effective memory horizon most consistent with behavioral data, and (ii) ensuring full interpretability to enable biologists to analyze underlying decision-making strategies and finally (iii) providing a mathematical framework linking bee policy search with bandit formulations under varying exploration-exploitation dynamics, and releasing a novel dataset of 80 tracked bees observed under diverse weather conditions. This benchmark facilitates research on pollinator cognition and supports ecological governance by improving simulations of insect behavior in agroecosystems. Our findings shed new light on the learning strategies and memory interplay shaping pollinator decision-making.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods ignore the interdependency between robotic functionalities and communication conditions, leading to excessive communication overhead. This paper revolutionizes edge robotics systems through integrated perception, motion, and communication (IPMC). As such, robots can dynamically adapt their communication strategies (i.e., compression ratio, transmission frequency, transmit power) by leveraging the knowledge of robotic perception and motion dynamics, thus reducing the need for excessive sensor data uploads. Furthermore, by leveraging the learning to optimize (LTO) paradigm, an imitation learning neural network is designed and implemented, which reduces the computational complexity by over 10x compared to state-of-the art optimization solvers. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed IPMC and the real-time execution capability of LTO.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Conditions for Diffusion models in Robotic Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15510v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While pre-trained visual representations have significantly advanced imitation learning, they are often task-agnostic as they remain frozen during policy learning. In this work, we explore leveraging pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models to obtain task-adaptive visual representations for robotic control, without fine-tuning the model itself. However, we find that naively applying textual conditions - a successful strategy in other vision domains - yields minimal or even negative gains in control tasks. We attribute this to the domain gap between the diffusion model's training data and robotic control environments, leading us to argue for conditions that consider the specific, dynamic visual information required for control. To this end, we propose ORCA, which introduces learnable task prompts that adapt to the control environment and visual prompts that capture fine-grained, frame-specific details. Through facilitating task-adaptive representations with our newly devised conditions, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on various robotic control benchmarks, significantly surpassing prior methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://orca-rc.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Perfect Prediction or Plenty of Proposals? What Matters Most in Planning for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15505v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditionally, prediction and planning in autonomous driving (AD) have been treated as separate, sequential modules. Recently, there has been a growing shift towards tighter integration of these components, known as Integrated Prediction and Planning (IPP), with the aim of enabling more informed and adaptive decision-making. However, it remains unclear to what extent this integration actually improves planning performance. In this work, we investigate the role of prediction in IPP approaches, drawing on the widely adopted Val14 benchmark, which encompasses more common driving scenarios with relatively low interaction complexity, and the interPlan benchmark, which includes highly interactive and out-of-distribution driving situations. Our analysis reveals that even access to perfect future predictions does not lead to better planning outcomes, indicating that current IPP methods often fail to fully exploit future behavior information. Instead, we focus on high-quality proposal generation, while using predictions primarily for collision checks. We find that many imitation learning-based planners struggle to generate realistic and plausible proposals, performing worse than PDM - a simple lane-following approach. Motivated by this observation, we build on PDM with an enhanced proposal generation method, shifting the emphasis towards producing diverse but realistic and high-quality proposals. This proposal-centric approach significantly outperforms existing methods, especially in out-of-distribution and highly interactive settings, where it sets new state-of-the-art results.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

Learning is based on demonstrations of some correct answer to each training question, as in Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT). We formalize the problem as offline imitation learning in contextual bandits, with demonstrations from some optimal policy, without explicitly observed rewards. Prior work assumes that the demonstrator belongs to a low-complexity policy class, which motivates maximum likelihood estimation (i.e., log-loss minimization). In contrast, we propose relying only on the reward model (specifying which answers are correct) being in a low-cardinality class, which we argue is a weaker assumption. We show that likelihood maximization methods can fail in this case, and instead devise an alternative novel approach that learns with sample complexity logarithmic in the cardinality of the reward class. Our work motivates looking beyond likelihood maximization when learning from correct demonstrations.</p></details> | Comments are welcome |

Existing robotic solutions remain expensive and require technical expertise, limiting accessibility. This work introduces a low-cost robotic arm for assistive tasks such as feeding, cleaning spills, and fetching medicine. The system uses imitation learning from demonstration videos, requiring no task-specific programming or manual labeling. The robot consists of six servo motors, dual cameras, and 3D-printed grippers. Data collection via teleoperation with a leader arm yielded 50,000 video frames across the three tasks. A novel Phased Action Chunking Transformer (PACT) captures temporal dependencies and segments motion dynamics, while a Temporal Ensemble (TE) method refines trajectories to improve accuracy and smoothness. Evaluated across five model sizes and four architectures, with ten hours of real-world testing, the system achieved over 90% task accuracy, up to 40% higher than baselines. PACT enabled a 5x model size reduction while maintaining 75% accuracy. Saliency analysis showed reliance on key visual cues, and phase token gradients peaked at critical trajectory moments, indicating effective temporal reasoning. Future work will explore bimanual manipulation and mobility for expanded assistive capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures.

Existing approaches often rely on pre-collected expert demonstrations and train policies via imitation learning (IL) or offline reinforcement learning (RL). However, obtaining high-quality demonstrations for precision tasks is difficult and time-consuming, while offline RL commonly suffers from distribution shifts and low data efficiency. We introduce a Role-Model Reinforcement Learning (RM-RL) framework that unifies online and offline training in real-world environments. The key idea is a role-model strategy that automatically generates labels for online training data using approximately optimal actions, eliminating the need for human demonstrations. RM-RL reformulates policy learning as supervised training, reducing instability from distribution mismatch and improving efficiency. A hybrid training scheme further leverages online role-model data for offline reuse, enhancing data efficiency through repeated sampling. Extensive experiments show that RM-RL converges faster and more stably than existing RL methods, yielding significant gains in real-world manipulation: 53% improvement in translation accuracy and 20% in rotation accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate the successful execution of a challenging task, precisely placing a cell plate onto a shelf, highlighting the framework's effectiveness where prior methods fail.</p></details> |  |
| **[Act to See, See to Act: Diffusion-Driven Perception-Action Interplay for Adaptive Policies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25822v3)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing imitation learning methods decouple perception and action, which overlooks the causal reciprocity between sensory representations and action execution that humans naturally leverage for adaptive behaviors. To bridge this gap, we introduce Action-Guided Diffusion Policy (DP-AG), a unified representation learning that explicitly models a dynamic interplay between perception and action through probabilistic latent dynamics. DP-AG encodes latent observations into a Gaussian posterior via variational inference and evolves them using an action-guided SDE, where the Vector-Jacobian Product (VJP) of the diffusion policy's noise predictions serves as a structured stochastic force driving latent updates. To promote bidirectional learning between perception and action, we introduce a cycle-consistent contrastive loss that organizes the gradient flow of the noise predictor into a coherent perception-action loop, enforcing mutually consistent transitions in both latent updates and action refinements. Theoretically, we derive a variational lower bound for the action-guided SDE, and prove that the contrastive objective enhances continuity in both latent and action trajectories. Empirically, DP-AG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across simulation benchmarks and real-world UR5 manipulation tasks. As a result, our DP-AG offers a promising step toward bridging biological adaptability and artificial policy learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>39th ...</summary><p>39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |

We present RL-100, a real-world reinforcement learning training framework built on diffusion visuomotor policies trained bu supervised learning. RL-100 introduces a three-stage pipeline. First, imitation learning leverages human priors. Second, iterative offline reinforcement learning uses an Offline Policy Evaluation procedure, abbreviated OPE, to gate PPO-style updates that are applied in the denoising process for conservative and reliable improvement. Third, online reinforcement learning eliminates residual failure modes. An additional lightweight consistency distillation head compresses the multi-step sampling process in diffusion into a single-step policy, enabling high-frequency control with an order-of-magnitude reduction in latency while preserving task performance. The framework is task-, embodiment-, and representation-agnostic and supports both 3D point clouds and 2D RGB inputs, a variety of robot platforms, and both single-step and action-chunk policies. We evaluate RL-100 on seven real-robot tasks spanning dynamic rigid-body control, such as Push-T and Agile Bowling, fluids and granular pouring, deformable cloth folding, precise dexterous unscrewing, and multi-stage orange juicing. RL-100 attains 100\% success across evaluated trials for a total of 900 out of 900 episodes, including up to 250 out of 250 consecutive trials on one task. The method achieves near-human teleoperation or better time efficiency and demonstrates multi-hour robustness with uninterrupted operation lasting up to two hours.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://lei-kun.github.io/RL-100/</p></details> |

Existing teleoperation systems often fail to guarantee high-precision data collection across diverse types of teleoperation devices. To address this, we developed Open TeleDex, a unified teleoperation framework engineered for demonstration data collection. Open TeleDex specifically tackles the TripleAny challenge, seamlessly supporting any robotic arm, any dexterous hand, and any external input device. Furthermore, we propose a novel hand pose retargeting algorithm that significantly boosts the interoperability of Open TeleDex, enabling robust and accurate compatibility with an even wider spectrum of heterogeneous master and slave equipment.

As its typical physical embodiment, humanoid robots have shown great promise through robot learning algorithms in recent years. In this study, a hardware platform, including humanoid robot and exoskeleton-style teleoperation cabin, was developed to realize intuitive remote manipulation and efficient collection of anthropomorphic action data. To improve the perception representation of humanoid robot, an imitation learning framework, termed Frequency-Enhanced Wavelet-based Transformer (FEWT), was proposed, which consists of two primary modules: Frequency-Enhanced Efficient Multi-Scale Attention (FE-EMA) and Time-Series Discrete Wavelet Transform (TS-DWT). By combining multi-scale wavelet decomposition with the residual network, FE-EMA can dynamically fuse features from both cross-spatial and frequency-domain. This fusion is able to capture feature information across various scales effectively, thereby enhancing model robustness. Experimental performance demonstrates that FEWT improves the success rate of the state-of-the-art algorithm (Action Chunking with Transformers, ACT baseline) by up to 30% in simulation and by 6-12% in real-world.</p></details> |  |
| **[Restoring Noisy Demonstration for Imitation Learning With Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14467v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation learning (IL) aims to learn a policy from expert demonstrations and has been applied to various applications. By learning from the expert policy, IL methods do not require environmental interactions or reward signals. However, most existing imitation learning algorithms assume perfect expert demonstrations, but expert demonstrations often contain imperfections caused by errors from human experts or sensor/control system inaccuracies. To address the above problems, this work proposes a filter-and-restore framework to best leverage expert demonstrations with inherent noise. Our proposed method first filters clean samples from the demonstrations and then learns conditional diffusion models to recover the noisy ones. We evaluate our proposed framework and existing methods in various domains, including robot arm manipulation, dexterous manipulation, and locomotion. The experiment results show that our proposed framework consistently outperforms existing methods across all the tasks. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each component and demonstrate the framework's robustness to different noise types and levels. These results confirm the practical applicability of our framework to noisy offline demonstration data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems (TNNLS)</p></details> |

Although most interactive imitation learning methods focus on correcting the agent's action at the current state, they do not adjust its actions in future states, which may be potentially more hazardous. To address this, we introduce Predictive Preference Learning from Human Interventions (PPL), which leverages the implicit preference signals contained in human interventions to inform predictions of future rollouts. The key idea of PPL is to bootstrap each human intervention into L future time steps, called the preference horizon, with the assumption that the agent follows the same action and the human makes the same intervention in the preference horizon. By applying preference optimization on these future states, expert corrections are propagated into the safety-critical regions where the agent is expected to explore, significantly improving learning efficiency and reducing human demonstrations needed. We evaluate our approach with experiments on both autonomous driving and robotic manipulation benchmarks and demonstrate its efficiency and generality. Our theoretical analysis further shows that selecting an appropriate preference horizon L balances coverage of risky states with label correctness, thereby bounding the algorithmic optimality gap.

Most existing imitation learning approaches often treat visuotactile feedback only as an additional observation, leaving applied forces as an uncontrolled consequence of gripper commands. In this work, we present Force-Aware Robotic Manipulation (FARM), an imitation learning framework that integrates high-dimensional tactile data to infer tactile-conditioned force signals, which in turn define a matching force-based action space. We collect human demonstrations using a modified version of the handheld Universal Manipulation Interface (UMI) gripper that integrates a GelSight Mini visual tactile sensor. For deploying the learned policies, we developed an actuated variant of the UMI gripper with geometry matching our handheld version. During policy rollouts, the proposed FARM diffusion policy jointly predicts robot pose, grip width, and grip force. FARM outperforms several baselines across three tasks with distinct force requirements -- high-force, low-force, and dynamic force adaptation -- demonstrating the advantages of its two key components: leveraging force-grounded, high-dimensional tactile observations and a force-based control space. The codebase and design files are open-sourced and available at https://tactile-farm.github.io .</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Static LLM Policies: Imitation-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13229v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems (RecSys) have become critical tools for enhancing user engagement by delivering personalized content across diverse digital platforms. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) demonstrate significant potential for improving RecSys, primarily due to their exceptional generalization capabilities and sophisticated contextual understanding, which facilitate the generation of flexible and interpretable recommendations. However, the direct deployment of LLMs as primary recommendation policies presents notable challenges, including persistent latency issues stemming from frequent API calls and inherent model limitations such as hallucinations and biases. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel offline reinforcement learning (RL) framework that leverages imitation learning from LLM-generated trajectories. Specifically, inverse reinforcement learning is employed to extract robust reward models from LLM demonstrations. This approach negates the need for LLM fine-tuning, thereby substantially reducing computational overhead. Simultaneously, the RL policy is guided by the cumulative rewards derived from these demonstrations, effectively transferring the semantic insights captured by the LLM. Comprehensive experiments conducted on two benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating superior performance when compared against state-of-the-art RL-based and in-context learning baselines.

This limitation stems not only from a conceptual gap but also from a fundamental computational barrier: prevailing architectures like Transformers are often constrained by quadratic complexity, rendering the processing of long, high-dimensional observation sequences infeasible. To overcome this dual challenge, we introduce Mamba Temporal Imitation Learning (MTIL). Our approach represents a new paradigm for robotic learning, which we frame as a practical synthesis of World Model and Dynamical System concepts. By leveraging the linear-time recurrent dynamics of State Space Models (SSMs), MTIL learns an implicit, action-oriented world model that efficiently encodes the entire trajectory history into a compressed, evolving state. This allows the policy to be conditioned on a comprehensive temporal context, transcending the confines of Markovian approaches. Through extensive experiments on simulated benchmarks (ACT, Robomimic, LIBERO) and on challenging real-world tasks, MTIL demonstrates superior performance against SOTA methods like ACT and Diffusion Policy, particularly in resolving long-term temporal ambiguities. Our findings not only affirm the necessity of full temporal context but also validate MTIL as a powerful and a computationally feasible approach for learning long-horizon, non-Markovian behaviors from high-dimensional observations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L), 2025. 8 pages, 5 figures</p></details> |
| **[CoIRL-AD: Collaborative-Competitive Imitation-Reinforcement Learning in Latent World Models for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12560v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end autonomous driving models trained solely with imitation learning (IL) often suffer from poor generalization. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) promotes exploration through reward maximization but faces challenges such as sample inefficiency and unstable convergence. A natural solution is to combine IL and RL. Moving beyond the conventional two-stage paradigm (IL pretraining followed by RL fine-tuning), we propose CoIRL-AD, a competitive dual-policy framework that enables IL and RL agents to interact during training. CoIRL-AD introduces a competition-based mechanism that facilitates knowledge exchange while preventing gradient conflicts. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show an 18% reduction in collision rate compared to baselines, along with stronger generalization and improved performance on long-tail scenarios.

| **[Agent Learning via Early Experience](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08558v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A long-term goal of language agents is to learn and improve through their own experience, ultimately outperforming humans in complex, real-world tasks. However, training agents from experience data with reinforcement learning remains difficult in many environments, which either lack verifiable rewards (e.g., websites) or require inefficient long-horizon rollouts (e.g., multi-turn tool use). As a result, most current agents rely on supervised fine-tuning on expert data, which is challenging to scale and generalizes poorly. This limitation stems from the nature of expert demonstrations: they capture only a narrow range of scenarios and expose the agent to limited environment diversity. We address this limitation with a middle-ground paradigm we call early experience: interaction data generated by the agent's own actions, where the resulting future states serve as supervision without reward signals. Within this paradigm we study two strategies of using such data: (1) Implicit world modeling, which uses collected states to ground the policy in environment dynamics; and (2) Self-reflection, where the agent learns from its suboptimal actions to improve reasoning and decision-making. We evaluate across eight diverse environments and multiple model families. Our approaches consistently improve effectiveness and out-of-domain generalization, highlighting the value of early experience. Moreover, in environments with verifiable rewards, our results provide promising signals that early experience offers a strong foundation for subsequent reinforcement learning, positioning it as a practical bridge between imitation learning and fully experience-driven agents.</p></details> | Work in progress |

Despite strong empirical results, the benefits of online interaction and the impact of stochasticity remain poorly understood. We address these gaps by introducing a model-based AIL algorithm (MB-AIL) and establish its horizon-free, second-order sample-complexity guarantees under general function approximations for both expert data and reward-free interactions. These second-order bounds provide an instance-dependent result that can scale with the variance of returns under the relevant policies and therefore tighten as the system approaches determinism. Together with second-order, information-theoretic lower bounds on a newly constructed hard-instance family, we show that MB-AIL attains minimax-optimal sample complexity for online interaction (up to logarithmic factors) with limited expert demonstrations and matches the lower bound for expert demonstrations in terms of the dependence on horizon $H$, precision $\epsilon$ and the policy variance $\sigma^2$. Experiments further validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate that a practical implementation of MB-AIL matches or surpasses the sample efficiency of existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>48 pa...</summary><p>48 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

However, such imitation learning approaches predominantly capture explicit kinematic patterns, so-called gaits, while overlooking the implicit passive dynamics. This work bridges this gap by incorporating a reward term guided by Impact Mitigation Factor (IMF), a physics-informed metric that quantifies a robot's ability to passively mitigate impacts. By integrating IMF with AMP, our approach enables RL policies to learn both explicit motion trajectories from animal reference motion and the implicit passive dynamic. We demonstrate energy efficiency improvements of up to 32%, as measured by the Cost of Transport (CoT), across both AMP and handcrafted reward structure.</p></details> |  |
| **[Failure Prediction at Runtime for Generative Robot Policies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09459v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation learning (IL) with generative models, such as diffusion and flow matching, has enabled robots to perform complex, long-horizon tasks. However, distribution shifts from unseen environments or compounding action errors can still cause unpredictable and unsafe behavior, leading to task failure. Early failure prediction during runtime is therefore essential for deploying robots in human-centered and safety-critical environments. We propose FIPER, a general framework for Failure Prediction at Runtime for generative IL policies that does not require failure data. FIPER identifies two key indicators of impending failure: (i) out-of-distribution (OOD) observations detected via random network distillation in the policy's embedding space, and (ii) high uncertainty in generated actions measured by a novel action-chunk entropy score. Both failure prediction scores are calibrated using a small set of successful rollouts via conformal prediction. A failure alarm is triggered when both indicators, aggregated over short time windows, exceed their thresholds. We evaluate FIPER across five simulation and real-world environments involving diverse failure modes. Our results demonstrate that FIPER better distinguishes actual failures from benign OOD situations and predicts failures more accurately and earlier than existing methods. We thus consider this work an important step towards more interpretable and safer generative robot policies.

| **[FOSSIL: Harnessing Feedback on Suboptimal Samples for Data-Efficient Generalisation with Imitation Learning for Embodied Vision-and-Language Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11307v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current approaches to embodied AI tend to learn policies from expert demonstrations. However, without a mechanism to evaluate the quality of demonstrated actions, they are limited to learning from optimal behaviour, or they risk replicating errors and inefficiencies. While reinforcement learning offers one alternative, the associated exploration typically results in sacrificing data efficiency. This work explores how agents trained with imitation learning can learn robust representations from both optimal and suboptimal demonstrations when given access to constructive language feedback as a means to contextualise different modes of behaviour. We directly provide language feedback embeddings as part of the input sequence into a Transformer-based policy, and optionally complement the traditional next action prediction objective with auxiliary self-supervised learning objectives for feedback prediction. We test our approach on a range of embodied Vision-and-Language tasks in our custom BabyAI-XGen environment and show significant improvements in agents' compositional generalisation abilities and robustness, suggesting that our data-efficient method allows models to successfully convert suboptimal behaviour into learning opportunities. Overall, our results suggest that language feedback is a competitive and intuitive alternative to intermediate scalar rewards for language-specified embodied tasks.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 Findings |
| **[Data Scaling Laws for Imitation Learning-Based End-to-End Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02689v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The end-to-end autonomous driving paradigm has recently attracted lots of attention due to its scalability. However, existing methods are constrained by the limited scale of real-world data, which hinders a comprehensive exploration of the scaling laws associated with end-to-end autonomous driving. To address this issue, we collected substantial data from various driving scenarios and behaviors and conducted an extensive study on the scaling laws of existing imitation learning-based end-to-end autonomous driving paradigms. Specifically, approximately 4 million demonstrations from 23 different scenario types were gathered, amounting to over 30,000 hours of driving demonstrations. We performed open-loop evaluations and closed-loop simulation evaluations in 1,400 diverse driving demonstrations (1,300 for open-loop and 100 for closed-loop) under stringent assessment conditions. Through experimental analysis, we discovered that (1) the performance of the driving model exhibits a power-law relationship with the amount of data, but this is not the case in closed-loop evaluation. The inconsistency between the two assessments shifts our focus toward the distribution of data rather than merely expanding its volume. (2) a small increase in the quantity of long-tailed data can significantly improve the performance for the corresponding scenarios; (3) appropriate scaling of data enables the model to achieve combinatorial generalization in novel scenes and actions. Our results highlight the critical role of data scaling in improving the generalizability of models across diverse autonomous driving scenarios, assuring safe deployment in the real world..

Although recent studies have made significant progress in humanoid whole-body control, loco-manipulation remains underexplored and often relies on hard-coded task definitions or costly real-world data collection, which limits autonomy and generalization. We present DemoHLM, a framework for humanoid loco-manipulation that enables generalizable loco-manipulation on a real humanoid robot from a single demonstration in simulation. DemoHLM adopts a hierarchy that integrates a low-level universal whole-body controller with high-level manipulation policies for multiple tasks. The whole-body controller maps whole-body motion commands to joint torques and provides omnidirectional mobility for the humanoid robot. The manipulation policies, learned in simulation via our data generation and imitation learning pipeline, command the whole-body controller with closed-loop visual feedback to execute challenging loco-manipulation tasks. Experiments show a positive correlation between the amount of synthetic data and policy performance, underscoring the effectiveness of our data generation pipeline and the data efficiency of our approach. Real-world experiments on a Unitree G1 robot equipped with an RGB-D camera validate the sim-to-real transferability of DemoHLM, demonstrating robust performance under spatial variations across ten loco-manipulation tasks.</p></details> |  |

Learning-based approaches attempt to address this challenge with advanced generative models, removing the dependency on over-engineered architectures for representation fusion. However, brute-force implementation by simply stacking transformer blocks lacks a dedicated mechanism for modeling interactive behaviors that are common in real driving scenarios. The scarcity of interactive driving data further exacerbates this problem, leaving conventional imitation learning methods ill-equipped to capture high-value interactive behaviors. We propose Flow Planner, which tackles these problems through coordinated innovations in data modeling, model architecture, and learning scheme. Specifically, we first introduce fine-grained trajectory tokenization, which decomposes the trajectory into overlapping segments to decrease the complexity of whole trajectory modeling. With a sophisticatedly designed architecture, we achieve efficient temporal and spatial fusion of planning and scene information, to better capture interactive behaviors. In addition, the framework incorporates flow matching with classifier-free guidance for multi-modal behavior generation, which dynamically reweights agent interactions during inference to maintain coherent response strategies, providing a critical boost for interactive scenario understanding. Experimental results on the large-scale nuPlan dataset and challenging interactive interPlan dataset demonstrate that Flow Planner achieves state-of-the-art performance among learning-based approaches while effectively modeling interactive behaviors in complex driving scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 6 figures.

| **[HoMeR: Learning In-the-Wild Mobile Manipulation via Hybrid Imitation and Whole-Body Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01185v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce HoMeR, an imitation learning framework for mobile manipulation that combines whole-body control with hybrid action modes that handle both long-range and fine-grained motion, enabling effective performance on realistic in-the-wild tasks. At its core is a fast, kinematics-based whole-body controller that maps desired end-effector poses to coordinated motion across the mobile base and arm. Within this reduced end-effector action space, HoMeR learns to switch between absolute pose predictions for long-range movement and relative pose predictions for fine-grained manipulation, offloading low-level coordination to the controller and focusing learning on task-level decisions. We deploy HoMeR on a holonomic mobile manipulator with a 7-DoF arm in a real home. We compare HoMeR to baselines without hybrid actions or whole-body control across 3 simulated and 3 real household tasks such as opening cabinets, sweeping trash, and rearranging pillows. Across tasks, HoMeR achieves an overall success rate of 79.17% using just 20 demonstrations per task, outperforming the next best baseline by 29.17 on average. HoMeR is also compatible with vision-language models and can leverage their internet-scale priors to better generalize to novel object appearances, layouts, and cluttered scenes. In summary, HoMeR moves beyond tabletop settings and demonstrates a scalable path toward sample-efficient, generalizable manipulation in everyday indoor spaces.

| **[FM-IRL: Flow-Matching for Reward Modeling and Policy Regularization in Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09222v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow Matching (FM) has shown remarkable ability in modeling complex distributions and achieves strong performance in offline imitation learning for cloning expert behaviors. However, despite its behavioral cloning expressiveness, FM-based policies are inherently limited by their lack of environmental interaction and exploration. This leads to poor generalization in unseen scenarios beyond the expert demonstrations, underscoring the necessity of online interaction with environment. Unfortunately, optimizing FM policies via online interaction is challenging and inefficient due to instability in gradient computation and high inference costs. To address these issues, we propose to let a student policy with simple MLP structure explore the environment and be online updated via RL algorithm with a reward model. This reward model is associated with a teacher FM model, containing rich information of expert data distribution. Furthermore, the same teacher FM model is utilized to regularize the student policy's behavior to stabilize policy learning. Due to the student's simple architecture, we avoid the gradient instability of FM policies and enable efficient online exploration, while still leveraging the expressiveness of the teacher FM model. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly enhances learning efficiency, generalization, and robustness, especially when learning from suboptimal expert data.</p></details> | 20 pages |

In this paper, we investigate whether similar data scaling laws exist in robotics, particularly in robotic manipulation, and whether appropriate data scaling can yield single-task robot policies that can be deployed zero-shot for any object within the same category in any environment. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study on data scaling in imitation learning. By collecting data across numerous environments and objects, we study how a policy's generalization performance changes with the number of training environments, objects, and demonstrations. Throughout our research, we collect over 40,000 demonstrations and execute more than 15,000 real-world robot rollouts under a rigorous evaluation protocol. Our findings reveal several intriguing results: the generalization performance of the policy follows a roughly power-law relationship with the number of environments and objects. The diversity of environments and objects is far more important than the absolute number of demonstrations; once the number of demonstrations per environment or object reaches a certain threshold, additional demonstrations have minimal effect. Based on these insights, we propose an efficient data collection strategy. With four data collectors working for one afternoon, we collect sufficient data to enable the policies for two tasks to achieve approximately 90% success rates in novel environments with unseen objects.</p></details> |  |
| **[Precise Mobile Manipulation of Small Everyday Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13964v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many everyday mobile manipulation tasks require precise interaction with small objects, such as grasping a knob to open a cabinet or pressing a light switch. In this paper, we develop Servoing with Vision Models (SVM), a closed-loop framework that enables a mobile manipulator to tackle such precise tasks involving the manipulation of small objects. SVM uses state-of-the-art vision foundation models to generate 3D targets for visual servoing to enable diverse tasks in novel environments. Naively doing so fails because of occlusion by the end-effector. SVM mitigates this using vision models that out-paint the end-effector, thereby significantly enhancing target localization. We demonstrate that aided by out-painting methods, open-vocabulary object detectors can serve as a drop-in module for SVM to seek semantic targets (e.g. knobs) and point tracking methods can help SVM reliably pursue interaction sites indicated by user clicks. We conduct a large-scale evaluation spanning experiments in 10 novel environments across 6 buildings including 72 different object instances. SVM obtains a 71% zero-shot success rate on manipulating unseen objects in novel environments in the real world, outperforming an open-loop control method by an absolute 42% and an imitation learning baseline trained on 1000+ demonstrations also by an absolute success rate of 50%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project webpage: https://arjung128.github.io/svm</p></details> |

Advances in imitation learning for robotics have expanded possibilities for reproducing human and animal movements. A key challenge for realistic multi-animal simulation in biology is bridging the gap between unknown real-world transition models and their simulated counterparts. Because locomotion dynamics are seldom known, relying solely on mathematical models is insufficient; constructing a simulator that both reproduces real trajectories and supports reward-driven optimization remains an open problem. We introduce a data-driven simulator for multi-animal behavior based on deep reinforcement learning and counterfactual simulation. We address the ill-posed nature of the problem caused by high degrees of freedom in locomotion by estimating movement variables of an incomplete transition model as actions within an RL framework. We also employ a distance-based pseudo-reward to align and compare states between cyber and physical spaces. Validated on artificial agents, flies, newts, and silkmoth, our approach achieves higher reproducibility of species-specific behaviors and improved reward acquisition compared with standard imitation and RL methods. Moreover, it enables counterfactual behavior prediction in novel experimental settings and supports multi-individual modeling for flexible what-if trajectory generation, suggesting its potential to simulate and elucidate complex multi-animal behaviors.</p></details> | 21 pages, 7 figures |
| **[A3RNN: Bi-directional Fusion of Bottom-up and Top-down Process for Developmental Visual Attention in Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10221v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates the developmental interaction between top-down (TD) and bottom-up (BU) visual attention in robotic learning. Our goal is to understand how structured, human-like attentional behavior emerges through the mutual adaptation of TD and BU mechanisms over time. To this end, we propose a novel attention model $A^3 RNN$ that integrates predictive TD signals and saliency-based BU cues through a bi-directional attention architecture. We evaluate our model in robotic manipulation tasks using imitation learning. Experimental results show that attention behaviors evolve throughout training, from saliency-driven exploration to prediction-driven direction. Initially, BU attention highlights visually salient regions, which guide TD processes, while as learning progresses, TD attention stabilizes and begins to reshape what is perceived as salient. This trajectory reflects principles from cognitive science and the free-energy framework, suggesting the importance of self-organizing attention through interaction between perception and internal prediction. Although not explicitly optimized for stability, our model exhibits more coherent and interpretable attention patterns than baselines, supporting the idea that developmental mechanisms contribute to robust attention formation.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |
| **[UF-RNN: Real-Time Adaptive Motion Generation Using Uncertainty-Driven Foresight Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10217v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training robots to operate effectively in environments with uncertain states, such as ambiguous object properties or unpredictable interactions, remains a longstanding challenge in robotics. Imitation learning methods typically rely on successful examples and often neglect failure scenarios where uncertainty is most pronounced. To address this limitation, we propose the Uncertainty-driven Foresight Recurrent Neural Network (UF-RNN), a model that combines standard time-series prediction with an active "Foresight" module. This module performs internal simulations of multiple future trajectories and refines the hidden state to minimize predicted variance, enabling the model to selectively explore actions under high uncertainty. We evaluate UF-RNN on a door-opening task in both simulation and a real-robot setting, demonstrating that, despite the absence of explicit failure demonstrations, the model exhibits robust adaptation by leveraging self-induced chaotic dynamics in its latent space. When guided by the Foresight module, these chaotic properties stimulate exploratory behaviors precisely when the environment is ambiguous, yielding improved success rates compared to conventional stochastic RNN baselines. These findings suggest that integrating uncertainty-driven foresight into imitation learning pipelines can significantly enhance a robot's ability to handle unpredictable real-world conditions.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Reducing Cognitive Overhead in Tool Use via Multi-Small-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08882v4)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in multi-agent systems highlight the potential of specialized small agents that collaborate via division of labor. Existing tool-integrated reasoning systems, however, often follow a single-agent paradigm in which one large model interleaves long-horizon reasoning with precise tool operations, leading to cognitive-load interference and unstable coordination. We present MSARL, a Multi-Small-Agent Reinforcement Learning framework that explicitly decouples reasoning from tool use. In MSARL, a Reasoning Agent decomposes problems and plans tool invocations, while multiple Tool Agents specialize in specific external tools, each trained via a combination of imitation learning and reinforcement learning with role-specific rewards. On mathematical problem solving with code execution, MSARL significantly improves reasoning stability and final-answer accuracy over single-agent baselines. Moreover, the architecture generalizes to diverse tool-use tasks, demonstrating that cognitive-role decoupling with small agents is a scalable blueprint for multi-agent AI design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Motion Tracks: A Unified Representation for Human-Robot Transfer in Few-Shot Imitation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06994v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Teaching robots to autonomously complete everyday tasks remains a challenge. Imitation Learning (IL) is a powerful approach that imbues robots with skills via demonstrations, but is limited by the labor-intensive process of collecting teleoperated robot data. Human videos offer a scalable alternative, but it remains difficult to directly train IL policies from them due to the lack of robot action labels. To address this, we propose to represent actions as short-horizon 2D trajectories on an image. These actions, or motion tracks, capture the predicted direction of motion for either human hands or robot end-effectors. We instantiate an IL policy called Motion Track Policy (MT-pi) which receives image observations and outputs motion tracks as actions. By leveraging this unified, cross-embodiment action space, MT-pi completes tasks with high success given just minutes of human video and limited additional robot demonstrations. At test time, we predict motion tracks from two camera views, recovering 6DoF trajectories via multi-view synthesis. MT-pi achieves an average success rate of 86.5% across 4 real-world tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art IL baselines which do not leverage human data or our action space by 40%, and generalizes to scenarios seen only in human videos. Code and videos are available on our website https://portal-cornell.github.io/motion_track_policy/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dyna-Think: Synergizing Reasoning, Acting, and World Model Simulation in AI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00320v3)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in reasoning with large language models (LLMs), such as DeepSeek-R1, demonstrates impressive capabilities in domains like mathematics and coding, by exhibiting complex cognitive behaviors such as verification, goal decomposition, and self-reflection. However, it is unclear what behavior is effective and what behavior is missing for long-horizon AI agents tasks. In this work, we propose Dyna-Think, a thinking framework that integrates planning with an internal world model with reasoning and acting to enhance AI agent performance. To enable Dyna-Think, we propose Dyna-Think Imitation Learning (DIT) and Dyna-Think Dyna Training (DDT). To initialize a policy with Dyna-Think, DIT reconstructs the thinking process of R1 to focus on performing world model simulation relevant to the proposed (and planned) action, and trains the policy using this reconstructed data. To enhance Dyna-Think, DDT uses a two-stage training process to first improve the agent's world modeling ability via objectives such as state prediction or critique generation, and then improve the agent's action via policy training. We evaluate our methods on OSWorld and WindowsAgentArena, and demonstrate that Dyna-Think improves the agent's in-domain and out-of-domain performance, achieving similar best-of-n performance compared to R1 while generating 2x less tokens on average. Our extensive empirical studies reveal that 1) using critique generation for world model training is effective to improve policy performance; and 2) AI agents with better performance correlate with better world modeling abilities. We believe our results suggest a promising research direction to integrate world model simulation into AI agents to enhance their reasoning, planning, and acting capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Autonomous Soft Robotic Guidewire Navigation via Imitation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09497v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In endovascular surgery, endovascular interventionists push a thin tube called a catheter, guided by a thin wire to a treatment site inside the patient's blood vessels to treat various conditions such as blood clots, aneurysms, and malformations. Guidewires with robotic tips can enhance maneuverability, but they present challenges in modeling and control. Automation of soft robotic guidewire navigation has the potential to overcome these challenges, increasing the precision and safety of endovascular navigation. In other surgical domains, end-to-end imitation learning has shown promising results. Thus, we develop a transformer-based imitation learning framework with goal conditioning, relative action outputs, and automatic contrast dye injections to enable generalizable soft robotic guidewire navigation in an aneurysm targeting task. We train the model on 36 different modular bifurcated geometries, generating 647 total demonstrations under simulated fluoroscopy, and evaluate it on three previously unseen vascular geometries. The model can autonomously drive the tip of the robot to the aneurysm location with a success rate of 83% on the unseen geometries, outperforming several baselines. In addition, we present ablation and baseline studies to evaluate the effectiveness of each design and data collection choice.

In the non-interactive setting, we prove a statistical lower bound that identifies the all-policy deviation concentrability coefficient as the fundamental complexity measure, and we show that Behavior Cloning (BC) is rate-optimal. For the interactive setting, we introduce a framework that combines reward-free reinforcement learning with interactive MAIL and instantiate it with an algorithm, MAIL-WARM. It improves the best previously known sample complexity from $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-8})$ to $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-2}),$ matching the dependence on $\varepsilon$ implied by our lower bound. Finally, we provide numerical results that support our theory and illustrate, in environments such as grid worlds, where Behavior Cloning fails to learn.</p></details> |  |

Glovity addresses key challenges in contact-rich tasks by providing intuitive wrench and tactile feedback, while overcoming embodiment gaps through precise retargeting. User studies demonstrate significant improvements: wrench feedback boosts success rates in book-flipping tasks from 48% to 78% and reduces completion time by 25%, while fingertip calibration enhances thin-object grasping success significantly compared to commercial glove. Furthermore, incorporating wrench signals into imitation learning (via DP-R3M) achieves high success rate in novel contact-rich scenarios, such as adaptive page flipping and force-aware handovers.

| **[When a Robot is More Capable than a Human: Learning from Constrained Demonstrators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09096v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning from demonstrations enables experts to teach robots complex tasks using interfaces such as kinesthetic teaching, joystick control, and sim-to-real transfer. However, these interfaces often constrain the expert's ability to demonstrate optimal behavior due to indirect control, setup restrictions, and hardware safety. For example, a joystick can move a robotic arm only in a 2D plane, even though the robot operates in a higher-dimensional space. As a result, the demonstrations collected by constrained experts lead to suboptimal performance of the learned policies. This raises a key question: Can a robot learn a better policy than the one demonstrated by a constrained expert? We address this by allowing the agent to go beyond direct imitation of expert actions and explore shorter and more efficient trajectories. We use the demonstrations to infer a state-only reward signal that measures task progress, and self-label reward for unknown states using temporal interpolation. Our approach outperforms common imitation learning in both sample efficiency and task completion time. On a real WidowX robotic arm, it completes the task in 12 seconds, 10x faster than behavioral cloning, as shown in real-robot videos on https://sites.google.com/view/constrainedexpert .</p></details> |  |
| **[iMoWM: Taming Interactive Multi-Modal World Model for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09036v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learned world models hold significant potential for robotic manipulation, as they can serve as simulator for real-world interactions. While extensive progress has been made in 2D video-based world models, these approaches often lack geometric and spatial reasoning, which is essential for capturing the physical structure of the 3D world. To address this limitation, we introduce iMoWM, a novel interactive world model designed to generate color images, depth maps, and robot arm masks in an autoregressive manner conditioned on actions. To overcome the high computational cost associated with three-dimensional information, we propose MMTokenizer, which unifies multi-modal inputs into a compact token representation. This design enables iMoWM to leverage large-scale pretrained VideoGPT models while maintaining high efficiency and incorporating richer physical information. With its multi-modal representation, iMoWM not only improves the visual quality of future predictions but also serves as an effective simulator for model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) and facilitates real-world imitation learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of iMoWM across these tasks, showcasing the advantages of multi-modal world modeling for robotic manipulation.

| **[An Imitative Reinforcement Learning Framework for Pursuit-Lock-Launch Missions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11562v3)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicle (UCAV) Within-Visual-Range (WVR) engagement, referring to a fight between two or more UCAVs at close quarters, plays a decisive role on the aerial battlefields. With the development of artificial intelligence, WVR engagement progressively advances towards intelligent and autonomous modes. However, autonomous WVR engagement policy learning is hindered by challenges such as weak exploration capabilities, low learning efficiency, and unrealistic simulated environments. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel imitative reinforcement learning framework, which efficiently leverages expert data while enabling autonomous exploration. The proposed framework not only enhances learning efficiency through expert imitation, but also ensures adaptability to dynamic environments via autonomous exploration with reinforcement learning. Therefore, the proposed framework can learn a successful policy of `pursuit-lock-launch' for UCAVs. To support data-driven learning, we establish an environment based on the Harfang3D sandbox. The extensive experiment results indicate that the proposed framework excels in this multistage task, and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art reinforcement learning and imitation learning methods. Thanks to the ability of imitating experts and autonomous exploration, our framework can quickly learn the critical knowledge in complex aerial combat tasks, achieving up to a 100% success rate and demonstrating excellent robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Geometry-aware Policy Imitation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08787v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a Geometry-aware Policy Imitation (GPI) approach that rethinks imitation learning by treating demonstrations as geometric curves rather than collections of state-action samples. From these curves, GPI derives distance fields that give rise to two complementary control primitives: a progression flow that advances along expert trajectories and an attraction flow that corrects deviations. Their combination defines a controllable, non-parametric vector field that directly guides robot behavior. This formulation decouples metric learning from policy synthesis, enabling modular adaptation across low-dimensional robot states and high-dimensional perceptual inputs. GPI naturally supports multimodality by preserving distinct demonstrations as separate models and allows efficient composition of new demonstrations through simple additions to the distance field. We evaluate GPI in simulation and on real robots across diverse tasks. Experiments show that GPI achieves higher success rates than diffusion-based policies while running 20 times faster, requiring less memory, and remaining robust to perturbations. These results establish GPI as an efficient, interpretable, and scalable alternative to generative approaches for robotic imitation learning.

To achieve this, substantial human demonstrations need to be collected to cover different spatial configurations for training a generalized visuomotor policy via imitation learning. Prior works explore a promising direction that leverages data generation to acquire abundant spatially diverse data from minimal source demonstrations. However, most approaches face significant sim-to-real gap and are often limited to constrained settings, such as fixed-base scenarios and predefined camera viewpoints. In this paper, we propose a real-to-real 3D data generation framework (R2RGen) that directly augments the pointcloud observation-action pairs to generate real-world data. R2RGen is simulator- and rendering-free, thus being efficient and plug-and-play. Specifically, given a single source demonstration, we introduce an annotation mechanism for fine-grained parsing of scene and trajectory. A group-wise augmentation strategy is proposed to handle complex multi-object compositions and diverse task constraints. We further present camera-aware processing to align the distribution of generated data with real-world 3D sensor. Empirically, R2RGen substantially enhances data efficiency on extensive experiments and demonstrates strong potential for scaling and application on mobile manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://r2rgen.github.io/</p></details> |

We show that a new quantity named the single policy deviation concentrability coefficient is unavoidable in the non-interactive imitation learning setting, and we provide an upper bound for behavioral cloning (BC) featuring such coefficient. BC exhibits substantial regret in games with high concentrability coefficient, leading us to utilize expert queries to develop and introduce two novel solution algorithms: MAIL-BRO and MURMAIL. The former employs a best response oracle and learns an $\varepsilon$-Nash equilibrium with $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-4})$ expert and oracle queries. The latter bypasses completely the best response oracle at the cost of a worse expert query complexity of order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-8})$. Finally, we provide numerical evidence, confirming our theoretical findings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Behavior Cloning: Robustness through Interactive Imitation and Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07645v2)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Behavior cloning (BC) traditionally relies on demonstration data, assuming the demonstrated actions are optimal. This can lead to overfitting under noisy data, particularly when expressive models are used (e.g., the energy-based model in Implicit BC). To address this, we extend behavior cloning into an iterative process of optimal action estimation within the Interactive Imitation Learning framework. Specifically, we introduce Contrastive policy Learning from Interactive Corrections (CLIC). CLIC leverages human corrections to estimate a set of desired actions and optimizes the policy to select actions from this set. Extensive simulation and real-robot experiments validate CLIC's advantages over existing state-of-the-art methods, including stable training of energy-based models, robustness to feedback noise, and adaptability to diverse feedback types beyond demonstrations. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/clic-webpage/CLIC.</p></details> |  |

Existing studies stimulate exploration through the lens of policy entropy, but such mechanical entropy maximization is prone to RL training instability due to the multi-turn distribution shifting. In this paper, we target the progressive exploration-exploitation balance under the guidance of the agent own experiences without succumbing to either entropy collapsing or runaway divergence. We propose SPEAR, a curriculum-based self-imitation learning (SIL) recipe for training agentic LLMs. It extends the vanilla SIL framework, where a replay buffer stores self-generated promising trajectories for off-policy update, by gradually steering the policy evolution within a well-balanced range of entropy across stages. Specifically, our approach incorporates a curriculum to manage the exploration process, utilizing intrinsic rewards to foster skill-level exploration and facilitating action-level exploration through SIL. At first, the auxiliary tool call reward plays a critical role in the accumulation of tool-use skills, enabling broad exposure to the unfamiliar distributions of the environment feedback with an upward entropy trend. As training progresses, self-imitation gets strengthened to exploit existing successful patterns from replayed experiences for comparative action-level exploration, accelerating solution iteration without unbounded entropy growth. To further stabilize training, we recalibrate the advantages of experiences in the replay buffer to address the potential policy drift. Reugularizations such as the clipping of tokens with high covariance between probability and advantage are introduced to the trajectory-level entropy control to curb over-confidence.</p></details> | 26 pages, 11 figures |

A key challenge is how to mitigate compounding errors in imitation learning, which lead to cascading failures over extended trajectories. To address these challenges, we propose the Diffusion Trajectory-guided Policy (DTP) framework, which generates 2D trajectories through a diffusion model to guide policy learning for long-horizon tasks. By leveraging task-relevant trajectories, DTP provides trajectory-level guidance to reduce error accumulation. Our two-stage approach first trains a generative vision-language model to create diffusion-based trajectories, then refines the imitation policy using them. Experiments on the CALVIN benchmark show that DTP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 25% in success rate, starting from scratch without external pretraining. Moreover, DTP significantly improves real-world robot performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, accepted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RAL)</p></details> |

Behavior cloning suffers from covariate shift, while Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) is notoriously unstable in multi-agent settings. We identify a key source of this instability: irrelevant interaction misguidance, where a discriminator penalizes an ego vehicle's realistic behavior due to unrealistic interactions among its neighbors. To address this, we propose Decomposed Multi-agent GAIL (DecompGAIL), which explicitly decomposes realism into ego-map and ego-neighbor components, filtering out misleading neighbor: neighbor and neighbor: map interactions. We further introduce a social PPO objective that augments ego rewards with distance-weighted neighborhood rewards, encouraging overall realism across agents. Integrated into a lightweight SMART-based backbone, DecompGAIL achieves state-of-the-art performance on the WOMD Sim Agents 2025 benchmark.</p></details> |  |

We propose a Denoising Diffusion-based Evolutionary Algorithm (DDEA) framework that synergistically integrates these paradigms. It utilizes pre-trained DDMs for both high-quality and diverse population initialization and a novel diffusion-based recombination operator, trained via imitation learning against an optimal demonstrator. Evaluating DDEA on the Maximum Independent Set problem on Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs, we demonstrate notable improvements over DIFUSCO, a leading DDM solver. DDEA consistently outperforms it given the same time budget, and surpasses Gurobi on larger graphs under the same time limit, with DDEA's solution sizes being 3.9% and 7.5% larger on the ER-300-400 and ER-700-800 datasets, respectively. In out-of-distribution experiments, DDEA provides solutions of 11.6% higher quality than DIFUSCO under the same time limit. Ablation studies confirm that both diffusion initialization and recombination are crucial. Our work highlights the potential of hybridizing DDMs and EAs, offering a promising direction for the development of powerful machine learning solvers for complex combinatorial optimization problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, code available in https://github.com/jsalvasoler/difusco_ddea</p></details> |

Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a more data-efficient solution capable of bridging this gap, yet its application has been constrained by a critical data bottleneck: existing RL datasets are orders of magnitude smaller and less diverse than web-scale pre-training corpora. To address this, we introduce the Webscale-RL pipeline, a scalable data engine that systematically converts large-scale pre-training documents into millions of diverse, verifiable question-answer pairs for RL. Using this pipeline, we construct the Webscale-RL dataset, containing 1.2 million examples across more than 9 domains. Our experiments show that the model trained on this dataset significantly outperforms continual pretraining and strong data refinement baselines across a suite of benchmarks. Notably, RL training with our dataset proves substantially more efficient, achieving the performance of continual pre-training with up to 100$\times$ fewer tokens. Our work presents a viable path toward scaling RL to pre-training levels, enabling more capable and efficient language models.</p></details> |  |

However, its adoption has been limited by the inherently sequential nature of traditional optimization algorithms, which are challenging to parallelize on modern computing hardware like GPUs. In this work, we tackle this bottleneck by introducing a GPU-accelerated differentiable optimization tool for MPC. This solver leverages sequential quadratic programming and a custom preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) routine with tridiagonal preconditioning to exploit the problem's structure and enable efficient parallelization. We demonstrate substantial speedups over CPU- and GPU-based baselines, significantly improving upon state-of-the-art training times on benchmark reinforcement learning and imitation learning tasks. Finally, we showcase the method on the challenging task of reinforcement learning for driving at the limits of handling, where it enables robust drifting of a Toyota Supra through water puddles.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Autonomous Tape Handling for Robotic Wound Redressing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06127v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chronic wounds, such as diabetic, pressure, and venous ulcers, affect over 6.5 million patients in the United States alone and generate an annual cost exceeding \$25 billion. Despite this burden, chronic wound care remains a routine yet manual process performed exclusively by trained clinicians due to its critical safety demands. We envision a future in which robotics and automation support wound care to lower costs and enhance patient outcomes. This paper introduces an autonomous framework for one of the most fundamental yet challenging subtasks in wound redressing: adhesive tape manipulation. Specifically, we address two critical capabilities: tape initial detachment (TID) and secure tape placement. To handle the complex adhesive dynamics of detachment, we propose a force-feedback imitation learning approach trained from human teleoperation demonstrations. For tape placement, we develop a numerical trajectory optimization method based to ensure smooth adhesion and wrinkle-free application across diverse anatomical surfaces. We validate these methods through extensive experiments, demonstrating reliable performance in both quantitative evaluations and integrated wound redressing pipelines. Our results establish tape manipulation as an essential step toward practical robotic wound care automation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distributional Inverse Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03013v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a distributional framework for offline Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) that jointly models uncertainty over reward functions and full distributions of returns. Unlike conventional IRL approaches that recover a deterministic reward estimate or match only expected returns, our method captures richer structure in expert behavior, particularly in learning the reward distribution, by minimizing first-order stochastic dominance (FSD) violations and thus integrating distortion risk measures (DRMs) into policy learning, enabling the recovery of both reward distributions and distribution-aware policies. This formulation is well-suited for behavior analysis and risk-aware imitation learning. Empirical results on synthetic benchmarks, real-world neurobehavioral data, and MuJoCo control tasks demonstrate that our method recovers expressive reward representations and achieves state-of-the-art imitation performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[MobRT: A Digital Twin-Based Framework for Scalable Learning in Mobile Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04592v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in robotics have been largely driven by imitation learning, which depends critically on large-scale, high-quality demonstration data. However, collecting such data remains a significant challenge-particularly for mobile manipulators, which must coordinate base locomotion and arm manipulation in high-dimensional, dynamic, and partially observable environments. Consequently, most existing research remains focused on simpler tabletop scenarios, leaving mobile manipulation relatively underexplored. To bridge this gap, we present \textit{MobRT}, a digital twin-based framework designed to simulate two primary categories of complex, whole-body tasks: interaction with articulated objects (e.g., opening doors and drawers) and mobile-base pick-and-place operations. \textit{MobRT} autonomously generates diverse and realistic demonstrations through the integration of virtual kinematic control and whole-body motion planning, enabling coherent and physically consistent execution. We evaluate the quality of \textit{MobRT}-generated data across multiple baseline algorithms, establishing a comprehensive benchmark and demonstrating a strong correlation between task success and the number of generated trajectories. Experiments integrating both simulated and real-world demonstrations confirm that our approach markedly improves policy generalization and performance, achieving robust results in both simulated and real-world environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reliable and Scalable Robot Policy Evaluation with Imperfect Simulators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04354v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rapid progress in imitation learning, foundation models, and large-scale datasets has led to robot manipulation policies that generalize to a wide-range of tasks and environments. However, rigorous evaluation of these policies remains a challenge. Typically in practice, robot policies are often evaluated on a small number of hardware trials without any statistical assurances. We present SureSim, a framework to augment large-scale simulation with relatively small-scale real-world testing to provide reliable inferences on the real-world performance of a policy. Our key idea is to formalize the problem of combining real and simulation evaluations as a prediction-powered inference problem, in which a small number of paired real and simulation evaluations are used to rectify bias in large-scale simulation. We then leverage non-asymptotic mean estimation algorithms to provide confidence intervals on mean policy performance. Using physics-based simulation, we evaluate both diffusion policy and multi-task fine-tuned \(\pi_0\) on a joint distribution of objects and initial conditions, and find that our approach saves over \(20-25\%\) of hardware evaluation effort to achieve similar bounds on policy performance.</p></details> |  |
